# LangGraph Course Projects

This repository collects the LangGraph agents built throughout the course and provides a clean starter template for new experiments. If you are following along lesson by lesson, start with the quickstart notebook, then clone whichever agent project you need.

## Quickstart Resources
- [LangGraph Quickstart Notebook](quick-start-for-langgraph.ipynb)
- [LangGraph Cloud Template](langgraph-cloud-template/) – minimal uv-powered scaffold for new agents

## Agent Projects
- [Competitor Monitoring Agent](competitor_monitoring_agent/) – tracks competitor movements and surfaces insights
- [Customer Support Agent](customer_support_agent/) – triages support tickets with semantic routing
- [Financial Analyst Agent](financial_analyst_agent/) – performs market analysis with LangGraph tool calls
- [Invoice Extraction Agent](invoice_extraction_agent/) – parses invoices into structured data
- [Joke Generator](joke_generator/) – demonstrates lightweight creative prompting
- [Marketing Blog Agent](marketing_blog_agent/) – drafts marketing posts with research assists
- [Open Deep Research](open_deep_research/) – orchestrates multistep research tasks
- [Personal Coach Agent with mem0](personal_coach_agent_with_mem0/) – showcases memory-augmented coaching
- [Testimonial Video Generator](testimonial_video_generator/) – scripts testimonial videos from raw input
- [Video Generation Agent](video_generation_agent/) – plans and iterates on video briefs

## How to Use This Repo
1. Pick an agent folder and open its `README.md` for setup details.
2. Use `uv` commands listed in each project to install dependencies and run the graph locally.
3. Need a fresh starting point? Copy the `langgraph-cloud-template` directory and rename it for your new agent.

Happy building!
