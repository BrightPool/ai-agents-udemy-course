<p>Hi Rhys,</p>

<p>Here’s the daily scoop:</p>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>{"executive_summary":"Google is consolidating product and partner messaging into polished, centralized blogs across Android, Chrome/Chromebooks, Wear OS, Play, Nest and Fitbit to communicate roadmaps, developer guidance, security/privacy improvements and monetization playbooks. The consistent, accessible design system, aggregated hubs and interactive assets indicate a strategic investment in discoverability and partner/customer influence; the Fitbit hub is a minor outlier primarily serving as an aggregator rather than a source of detailed on-page content."}</p>
