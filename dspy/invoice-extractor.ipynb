      "- Also accept a standalone “#12345” near the invoice header when clearly serving as the invoice number.\n",

      "6) bank_name\n",

      "- Preserve formatting (retain spaces/dashes), e.g., “123-456-7890”, “0123 4567 8901”.\n",

      "\n",
      "Disambiguation and edge cases\n",
      "- Template/theme headings: Ignore descriptive titles like color/style (“White Modern Sales Invoice”, “Beige Elegant Professional Business Invoice”, “Freelance Invoice Template”). These are not company names.\n",

      "  b) The most prominent brand/header name near the main “INVOICE” title (ignore generic template words like “Invoice Template”, “Professional Service Invoice”).\n",
      "- If both a person and a company name appear together for the issuer, prefer the company name (e.g., choose “Wardi LLC” over “Olivia Wilson”).\n",
      "- If there is a distinct “PAY TO”/“Payable to” block, treat the entity named there as the issuer; prefer the company name in that block if present. If only a person is named there and no clear company is tied to that pay-to block, use the person’s name as company.\n",
      "- Special caution for misleading “Customer:” lines:\n",
      "  - If the only named organization appears under a “Customer:” label but the surrounding details clearly belong to the service provider/issuer (e.g., the email domain matches the name, the bank/account details match that name, or there is no other party indicated), treat that name as the issuer company and do NOT use it as billed_to.\n",
      "- Value must be just the name (exclude addresses, phones, emails, URLs, tags like “Agency”, unless they are part of the official name).\n",
      "\n",
      "2) billed_to (customer/recipient being invoiced)\n",
      "- Look for labels: “Bill To”, “Billed To”, “Invoice To”, “Customer”, “Client”, “Ship To” (if clearly used as billing/customer), “Sold To”, “Recipient”, “Attention”.\n",
      "- If both a company and a person appear under the billed-to label, prefer the company name; otherwise use a person’s name if that’s all that’s available.\n",
      "- If no explicit billed-to label exists but two distinct parties are clearly indicated (e.g., an issuer/payee block and another party with address/contact details), infer billed_to as the non-issuer party’s name (use the name line only).\n",
      "- Do not infer a billed_to if only one party is present; in that case, set billed_to to \"\".\n",
      "- Use only the name (no address, phone, or email).\n",

      "3) invoice_number\n",

      "- Also accept a stand-alone “#<number>” near the invoice header info (strip the leading “#”).\n",
      "- Preserve the identifier exactly, including hyphens and leading zeros (e.g., “INV-00001”, “2000-15”, “001”).\n",
      "- Remove label text and any trailing punctuation or glued words (e.g., “12345INVOICE” → “12345”).\n",
      "\n",
      "4) invoice_date\n",
      "- The invoice date (not service date, not due date).\n",
      "- Prefer labels like: “Invoice Date”, “DATE:”, “Date of Issue”, “DATE OF ISSUE”, “Issued on”.\n",
      "- If only a generic “Date” appears near the invoice header info (adjacent to “Invoice No/ID” etc.), use that.\n",
      "- Exclude “Due Date”, “Payment Date”, “Service Date”, “Delivery Date”.\n",
      "- Keep the original formatting (e.g., “01/01/2023”, “15/08/2028”, “11.02.2030”, “23 March 2025”). If extra non-date tokens are stuck to the end (e.g., “…INVOICE”), trim them off.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) total_amount (grand total due)\n",
      "- Prefer explicit grand-total labels such as: “TOTAL”, “TOTAL AMOUNT”, “TOTAL AMOUNT DUE”, “Amount Due”, “Balance Due”, “Grand Total”.\n",
      "- Do not use subtotal, tax, or partial totals.\n",
      "- If multiple totals are present, choose the final grand total, typically the bottom-most value after taxes/discounts or the value emphasized in a total/amount-due box.\n",
      "- Preserve currency symbols and formatting exactly as shown (e.g., “$625.00”, “$ 346.50”, “€1.234,56”, “$1.100”).\n",
      "\n",
      "6) bank_name\n",
      "- The bank’s name where payment should be made.\n",
      "- Look for labels: “Bank Name”, “Bank:”, “Bank”.\n",
      "- Use a textual bank name (alphabetic words). Do NOT take numeric strings or bank codes as the bank name. Do NOT use “Bank Code”.\n",
      "- If “Bank:” appears but the value is on an adjacent line (above or below), use the nearest textual bank name.\n",
      "- In multi-line stacked label/value blocks, match in order (see “Stacked/misaligned labels” below).\n",
      "\n",
      "7) account_name\n",
      "- The name on the bank account.\n",
      "- Look for labels: “Account Name”, “Acct. Name”, “Account Holder”, “Beneficiary”, “Beneficiary Name”, “Payee”.\n",
      "- Use only the name (no bank, no extra lines). Preserve original casing as in the text.\n",
      "\n",
      "8) account_number\n",
      "- The bank account number.\n",
      "- Look for labels: “Account Number”, “Account No”, “Acct No”, “Acct. No.”, “Account #”, “A/C No”, “A/C #”, “IBAN” (use IBAN if it’s the only account number provided), “Account”.\n",
      "- Preserve formatting (keep spaces/dashes: e.g., “123-456-7890”, “0123 4567 8901”, “GB29 NWBK 6016 1331 9268 19”).\n",
      "- Prefer values that are clearly numeric/alphanumeric identifiers over words or phone numbers; rely on nearby labels to disambiguate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Disambiguation and edge cases:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Stacked/misaligned labels:\n",
      "  - Some templates stack labels on separate lines and put values on following lines with colons, e.g.:\n",
      "    Bank\n",
      "    Name\n",
      "    Account\n",
      "    : Fauget Bank\n",
      "    : Pedro fernandez\n",
      "    : 0123 4567 8901\n",
      "  - In such cases, treat “Bank Name Account” as an ordered list of labels and assign values in order: bank_name = first value (textual bank), account_name = second value (name-like), account_number = third value (numeric/alphanumeric).\n",
      "  - When a repeated generic label like “Account” appears for both name and number, decide by value type: alphabetic name-like → account_name; numeric/alphanumeric → account_number.\n",
      "\n",
      "- PAY TO vs header brand:\n",
      "  - If a distinct “PAY TO/Payable to/Remit to/Beneficiary” block exists, treat that entity as the issuer (company), even if a different brand appears near the “INVOICE” header. Prefer a company name over a person in that block if both appear; otherwise use the person.\n",
      "  - If no pay-to/issuer block exists, use the prominent brand near “INVOICE”.\n",
      "  - Do not treat generic decorative headings (e.g., “Professional Service Invoice”, “Invoice Template”) as company names.\n",
      "\n",
      "- “Customer” ambiguity:\n",
      "  - Use “Customer/Client/Bill To” as billed_to only if there is a clear issuer identified elsewhere.\n",
      "  - If “Customer:” is the only named entity but the surrounding contact/bank/email clearly belong to that same entity (i.e., it appears to be the issuer), use it as company and leave billed_to = \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "- Dates glued to words:\n",
      "  - If a date value has extra trailing tokens (e.g., “23 March 2025INVOICE”), strip the non-date suffix to keep only the date.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Totals:\n",
      "  - Use the final, grand total amount (often bottom-most, or explicitly “Amount Due”/“TOTAL” box).\n",
      "  - Do not compute totals unless the grand total is explicitly shown; if a grand total value is present, use it as-is (currency and separators preserved).\n",
      "\n",
      "- Cleaning and formatting:\n",
      "  - Trim surrounding spaces and trailing punctuation (e.g., trailing colon, period) from extracted values.\n",
      "  - Preserve internal formatting of IDs and amounts exactly as shown.\n",
      "  - Remove a leading “#” from invoice_number values (e.g., “#91028829” → “91028829”).\n",

      "- If both a company and a contact person are listed under the billed-to label, prefer the company; otherwise use the person’s name.\n",
      "- If “INVOICE TO” and “COMPANY” appear close together (even if concatenated as “INVOICE TOCOMPANY:”):\n",

      "- Also consider the prominent brand/company near the large “INVOICE” header (handle concatenations due to OCR, e.g., “INVOICEBorcelle” → “Borcelle”).\n",
      "- If a “PAY TO:”/beneficiary block lists both a person and a company, choose the company (e.g., pick “Wardi LLC” over “Olivia Wilson”).\n",
      "- Strong tie-breaker using bank section: If there is NO explicit issuer (“From”/“Pay To”/“Vendor”/brand) AND there is a clear “Account Name”/“Beneficiary” in bank details, you may use that name as the issuer.\n",
      "  Important constraints on this tie-breaker:\n",
      "  - Never override an explicit “Customer”/“Bill To” with the bank “Account Name” if they are the same string. In that case, set billed_to to that customer name and leave company as \"\" unless another distinct issuer is present.\n",
      "  - Do not set company and billed_to to the same value unless the document explicitly presents the same entity as both issuer and customer under clear role labels (rare). If ambiguous, prefer company = \"\" and keep billed_to from the customer label.\n",
      "- Do NOT pick generic template headers as the issuer (e.g., “Consulting Invoice Template”, “Professional Service Invoice”, “Trucking Invoice Template”, “Proforma Invoice Template”, “Green IT Company Professional Service Invoice”) if no distinct brand/entity appears.\n",
      "- Value should be just the name line (no address/phone/email).\n",
      "\n",
      "2) billed_to (customer/recipient being invoiced)\n",
      "- Look for labels: “Bill To”, “Billed To”, “Invoice To”, “INVOICE TO”, “Customer”, “Client”, “Ship To” (only if clearly used as the billing/customer context).\n",
      "- If both a company and a person appear under this label, prefer the company; otherwise use the person’s name.\n",
      "- If “INVOICE TO” and “COMPANY” appear close together (even if concatenated, e.g., “INVOICE TOCOMPANY:”):\n",
      "  - Map the entity following “INVOICE TO” to billed_to.\n",

      "- Do not include label text or trailing punctuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) invoice_date\n",
      "- The invoice issue date (not due date, not service date).\n",
      "- Prefer labels: “Invoice Date”, “Date of Issue”, “DATE OF ISSUE”. If both “Invoice Date” and “Date of Issue” are present and differ, use “Invoice Date”.\n",
      "- As a fallback, a generic “Date” is acceptable only when it appears in the invoice header/info block and is clearly the issue date.\n",
      "- Do NOT use “Due Date”, “DUE”, “Service Date”.\n",
      "- Keep the original date format/order as shown; normalize spacing around separators (e.g., “01 / 02 / 2023” → “01/02/2023”). Do not reorder day/month.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) total_amount (grand total due)\n",
      "- Prefer explicit grand total labels: “Amount Due”, “Balance Due”, “TOTAL”, “TOTAL AMOUNT”, “TOTAL AMOUNT DUE”, “Grand Total”.\n",
      "- If multiple totals are present, choose the final, bottom-most grand total (after taxes/discounts). Example: if “Total Amount $2500.00” appears earlier but a later “Total”/“Amount Due” shows “$2000.00”, pick “$2000.00”.\n",
      "- Preserve the currency symbol and number formatting (e.g., “$625.00”, “$ 346.50”, “€1.234,56”).\n",

      "6) bank_name\n",
      "- The bank’s name where payment should be made.\n",
      "- Look for “Bank Name”, “Bank:”.\n",

      "- If the name is on an adjacent line, associate the nearest plausible bank name.\n",
      "- Normalize whitespace and fix obvious OCR splits (e.g., “Thynk Unl imited Bank” → “Thynk Unlimited Bank”).\n",
      "\n",
      "7) account_name\n",
      "- The name on the bank account.\n",
      "- Look for “Account Name”, “Acct. Name”, “Account Holder”, “Beneficiary”.\n",
      "- Use the textual name only (no addresses/notes).\n",
      "\n",
      "8) account_number\n",
      "- The bank account number.\n",
      "- Look for “Account Number”, “Account No”, “Acct No”, “Acct. No.”, “Account #”, “A/C No”, “A/C #”, “IBAN” (if this is the only account number), or “Bank Account” when it clearly denotes the account number.\n",
      "- Preserve formatting (spaces/dashes) exactly as shown (e.g., “123-456-7890”, “0123 4567 8901”, “DE89 3704 0044 0532 0130 00”).\n",
      "- Heuristics to avoid phones/miscodes:\n",
      "  - Prefer numbers under explicit account labels over unlabeled numbers.\n",
      "  - If a number matches a phone pattern and also appears elsewhere as a phone, avoid using it unless it is the only value under a clear bank account label.\n",
      "  - Prefer longer account/IBAN-like strings when multiple candidates exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Disambiguation and tricky layouts:\n",
      "- Handle concatenated labels/values caused by OCR:\n",
      "  - “INVOICEBorcelle” → treat as label “INVOICE” + company “Borcelle”.\n",
      "  - “INVOICE TOCOMPANY:” → two labels; map values accordingly (billed_to after “INVOICE TO”, issuer after “COMPANY”).\n",
      "  - “$8987TOTAL” or “$ 8987TOTAL” → extract “$8987” / “$ 8987” as total_amount.\n",
      "- Issuer vs customer conflicts:\n",
      "  - If a “Customer”/“Bill To” is present and the same name also appears as “Account Name” in bank details, treat that name as billed_to. Do NOT also assign it to company unless there is an explicit issuer block that clearly indicates the same entity is the seller; otherwise set company to \"\".\n",
      "  - When a “PAY TO:” block lists both a person and a company, choose the company as issuer.\n",
      "- Avoid template placeholders:\n",
      "  - Do not set company to generic template branding (e.g., “Trucking Invoice Template”, “Proforma Invoice Template”). If no distinct issuer is present, leave company as \"\".\n",

      "- Extract the identifier exactly, preserving hyphens, letters, and leading zeros (e.g., “INV-00001”, “2000-15”, “001”).\n",
      "- Do not include label text or trailing punctuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) invoice_date\n",
      "- The invoice issue date (not due date, not service date).\n",
      "- Prefer labels in this order when values differ:\n",
      "  1. “Invoice Date”\n",
      "  2. “Date of Issue” / “DATE OF ISSUE”\n",
      "  3. A generic “Date” only when it appears within the invoice header/info block and is clearly the issue date.\n",
      "- Do NOT use “Due Date”, “DUE”, “Service Date”.\n",
      "- Keep the original date format/order as shown; normalize spacing around separators (e.g., “01 / 02 / 2023” → “01/02/2023”).\n",
      "\n",
      "5) total_amount (grand total due)\n",
      "- Prefer explicit grand total labels: “Amount Due”, “Balance Due”, “TOTAL”, “TOTAL:”, “TOTAL AMOUNT”, “TOTAL AMOUNT DUE”, “Grand Total”, “Total”.\n",
      "- When multiple totals are present, choose the final, bottom-most grand total after taxes/discounts. Example: if “Total Amount $2500.00” appears earlier but a later “Total”/“Amount Due” shows “$2000.00”, pick “$2000.00”.\n",
      "- Preserve the currency symbol and number formatting as shown (e.g., “$625.00”, “$ 346.50”, “€1.234,56”).\n",
      "- Ignore subtotal, tax, or intermediate totals, and ignore amounts near “Terms & Conditions” unless directly tied to a grand total label.\n",
      "- Handle OCR concatenations: “$8987TOTAL” or “$ 8987TOTAL” → extract “$8987” / “$ 8987” as total_amount.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) bank_name\n",
      "- The bank’s name where payment should be made.\n",
      "- Look for “Bank Name”, “Bank:”.\n",
      "- Prefer alphabetic bank names; do NOT use numeric strings/codes or “Bank Code” as the bank name.\n",
      "- If the name is on an adjacent line, associate the nearest plausible bank name.\n",
      "- Normalize whitespace and fix obvious OCR splits (e.g., “Thynk Unl imited Bank” → “Thynk Unlimited Bank”).\n",
      "\n",
      "7) account_name\n",
      "- The name on the bank account.\n",
      "- Look for “Account Name”, “Acct. Name”, “Account Holder”, “Beneficiary”, “Name:” when clearly within the payment/bank section.\n",
      "- Use the textual name only (no addresses/notes).\n",
      "\n",
      "8) account_number\n",
      "- The bank account number to be paid.\n",
      "- Look for “Account Number”, “Account No”, “Acct No”, “Acct. No.”, “Account #”, “A/C No”, “A/C #”, “IBAN” (if this is the only account number), or “Bank Account” when it clearly denotes the account number.\n",
      "- Preserve formatting (spaces/dashes) exactly as shown (e.g., “123-456-7890”, “0123 4567 8901”, “DE89 3704 0044 0532 0130 00”).\n",
      "- Heuristics to avoid phones/miscodes:\n",
      "  - Prefer numbers under explicit account labels over unlabeled numbers.\n",
      "  - If a number matches a phone pattern and also appears elsewhere as a phone, avoid using it unless it is the only value under a clear bank account label.\n",
      "  - Prefer longer account/IBAN-like strings when multiple candidates exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Disambiguation and OCR handling\n",
      "- Handle concatenated labels/values caused by OCR:\n",
      "  - “INVOICEBorcelle” → label “INVOICE” + company “Borcelle”.\n",
      "  - “INVOICE TOCOMPANY:” → two labels; map values accordingly (billed_to after “INVOICE TO”, issuer after “COMPANY”).\n",
      "  - “$8987TOTAL” or “$ 8987TOTAL” → extract the currency value for total_amount.\n",
      "- Issuer vs customer conflicts:\n",
      "  - If a “Customer”/“Bill To” is present and the same name also appears as “Account Name” in bank details, treat that name as billed_to. Do NOT also assign it to company unless there is a distinct issuer elsewhere; otherwise set company to \"\".\n",
      "  - When a “PAY TO:”/beneficiary block lists both a person and a company, choose the company as issuer.\n",
      "  - Do not set billed_to from a “PAY TO:”/beneficiary block. If no customer is present, leave billed_to as \"\".\n",
      "- Avoid template placeholders:\n",
      "  - Do not set company to generic template branding (e.g., “Trucking Invoice Template”, “Proforma Invoice Template”).\n",
      "- If no explicit billed_to exists but two distinct parties appear (e.g., an issuer/payee and a different named party with address/contact lines), infer billed_to as the non-issuer party; otherwise leave billed_to as \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Always output exactly (example skeleton)\n",

      "        \n",
      "        1) company (the issuing/seller entity)\n",
      "        - Look in this order:\n",
      "          a) Explicit issuer blocks/labels: “From”, “FROM:”, “Seller”, “Vendor”, “Supplier”, “Issued by”, “Company”, “PAY TO” / “Pay To”, “Service Provider”, “Freelancer: <name>”, “Consultant: <name>”.\n",
      "          b) Prominent company/person name near the invoice header only if it clearly denotes a real entity (not a template/theme descriptor).\n",
      "        - Prefer the company name if both a company and a person appear in the issuer block; if only a person appears, use that person’s name.\n",
      "        - Extract only the name line (omit address/contact).\n",
      "        - Do NOT use template/theme/descriptor titles as the company, such as:\n",
      "          - “Beige Gray Simple Minimalist Consultation Invoice”\n",
      "          - “Green IT Company Professional Service Invoice”\n",
      "          - “Pink Modern Service Invoice”\n",

      "          These are not company names.\n",
      "        \n",
      "        2) billed_to (the customer/recipient being invoiced)\n",
      "        - Look for: “Bill To”, “Billed To”, “Invoice To”, “Customer”, “Client”, “To:”, “ISSUED TO:”.\n",
      "        - Prefer the customer company name over a contact person if both are present; if only a person is present, use the person’s name.\n",
      "        - Extract only the name line (omit address/contact).\n",
      "        - Important: “PAY TO” (or “Pay To”) denotes the issuer (company), NOT the customer. Do not use “PAY TO” for billed_to.\n",
      "        \n",
      "        3) invoice_number\n",
      "        - Look for labels: “Invoice Number”, “Invoice No”, “Invoice #”, “Invoice NO.”, “Invoice ID”, “INVOICE NO.”, “INVOICE NO:”, “INVOICE ID:”.\n",
      "        - Also accept a standalone “#12345” near the invoice header when clearly serving as the invoice number.\n",
      "        - Preserve the exact formatting, including prefixes, leading zeros, separators, and “#” if present.\n",
      "        \n",
      "        4) invoice_date (the invoice issue date)\n",
      "        - Prefer labels: “Invoice Date”, “Date of Issue”, “Issue Date”, “DATE:”, “Date”.\n",
      "        - Do NOT use “Service Date”, “Due Date”, or “Payment Date”.\n",
      "        - If only an unlabeled date appears near the invoice header/number and no other date types are present, treat it as the invoice date.\n",
      "        - Preserve the original formatting (e.g., “08/01/2023”, “11.02.2030”, “5 December 2030”).\n",
      "        \n",
      "        5) total_amount (grand total due)\n",
      "        - Prefer labels in the summary/totals section: “TOTAL”, “TOTAL AMOUNT DUE”, “TOTAL AMOUNT”, “Amount Due”, “Balance Due”, “Grand Total”, “Total Amount”.\n",
      "        - Choose the final payable total from the summary block (often at or near the end), not a line-item total.\n",
      "        - Do NOT use “Sub-Total”, “Subtotal”, “Tax”, “Discount”, or intermediate sums.\n",
      "        - If multiple total-like amounts exist:\n",
      "          - Prefer “Amount Due”, “Total Amount”, “Grand Total”, “Balance Due” over a generic “Total” if both are present.\n",
      "          - Ignore percentages or rates (e.g., lines with “10%”).\n",
      "          - Pick the amount nearest to the clearest total label within the summary block.\n",
      "        \n",
      "        6) bank_name\n",
      "        - Look for “Bank Name:”, “Bank:”, or an unlabeled bank name line within a “Bank Details/Bank Information” section.\n",
      "        - Do NOT return “Bank Code” or routing numbers as the bank_name unless the actual bank name is explicitly provided.\n",
      "        \n",
      "        7) account_name\n",
      "        - Look for “Account Name”, “Account Holder”, “Beneficiary Name” within payment/bank details.\n",
      "        - Use only explicitly labeled values; do not infer from unrelated context or roles.\n",
      "        \n",
      "        8) account_number\n",
      "        - Look for “Account Number”, “Account No”, “Acct No”, “A/C No”, “AC No.”, “A/C #”.\n",
      "        - Preserve formatting (retain spaces/dashes), e.g., “123-456-7890”, “0123 4567 8901”.\n",
      "        - If only an IBAN is provided and no separate account number is present, use the IBAN as account_number (preserve its formatting).\n",
      "        - Do NOT use routing numbers, bank codes, or SWIFT/BIC as account_number.\n",
      "        \n",
      "        Disambiguation and edge cases\n",
      "        - Template/theme headings are NOT company names. Ignore stylistic/descriptor titles even if they contain industry terms (e.g., “Green IT Company Professional Service Invoice”).\n",
      "        - “Freelancer: <name>”, “Service Provider”, “PAY TO”, and “From” typically indicate the issuer (company).\n",
      "        - “ISSUED TO”, “Bill To”, “Client/Customer” indicate the recipient (billed_to).\n",
      "        - Multi-line blocks: when a block contains name + address/contact, extract only the name line for company or billed_to.\n",
      "        - If a clearly labeled bank detail coincides with a party name (e.g., account_name equals the customer), still extract the labeled bank fields as shown; do not reinterpret roles.\n",
      "        - If a field cannot be confidently located, set it to \"\".\n",
      "        \n",
      "        Validation before output\n",
      "        - Ensure all 8 keys are present with string values.\n",
