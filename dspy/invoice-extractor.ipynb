      "3) BILLED_TO\n",

      "4) COMPANY\n",
      "   - The issuing/seller company (the party sending the invoice).\n",
      "   - Prefer names near labels \"From\", \"Company\", or the prominent company name in the header.\n",
      "   - If multiple variants of the same name appear (e.g., different casing), choose a single canonical occurrence (you may use the one nearest \"From\" or header). If no seller/company is identifiable, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "5) TOTAL_AMOUNT\n",
      "   - The final amount payable.\n",

      "   - Do not use \"SUB-TOTAL\", \"SUBTOTAL\", \"TAX\", or line item totals.\n",

      "6) BANK_NAME\n",
      "   - Value following labels like \"Bank Name\".\n",

      "7) ACCOUNT_NAME\n",

      "- When capturing multi-line blocks (like BILLED_TO or COMPANY “From” blocks), stop at the next clear header/section label or a blank line to avoid including unrelated content.\n",
      "\n",
      "Field-specific rules and robust label variants:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) INVOICE_NUMBER\n",
      "   - Accepted labels (case-insensitive): \"Invoice Number\", \"Invoice No\", \"Invoice No.\", \"Invoice NO.\", \"Invoice #\", \"INVOICE NO.\", \"INVOICE NO\", \"INV#\", \"Invoice ID\", \"No.\", \"NO.\", \"Number:\", \"Invoice Num\".\n",
      "   - Also accept a standalone number prefixed with \"#\" near the main invoice header (e.g., under/next to \"INVOICE\" or \"INVOICE/TAX RECEIPT\").\n",
      "   - Capture the value on the same line or the next non-empty line.\n",
      "   - Strip a single leading \"#\" from the captured value; preserve everything else (e.g., \"INV-00008\", \"1009-01\", \"001\").\n",
      "\n",
      "2) INVOICE_DATE\n",
      "   - Preferred labels (in this order): \"Invoice Date\", \"Date of Issue\", \"Issue Date\", \"Date Issued\", \"Date\".\n",
      "   - Exclude due/other dates: do NOT use lines containing \"Due\", \"DUE\", \"Payment Due\", \"Pay by\", \"Service Date\", \"Delivery Date\", \"Ship Date\".\n",
      "   - If both a general \"Date\" and a more specific date label exist, use the most specific one tied to the invoice.\n",
      "   - If no label is present but there is a single standalone date clearly associated with the invoice header, use it.\n",
      "   - Keep the format exactly as written (e.g., \"01 / 02 / 2023\", \"1 APRIL 2022\", \"5 December 2030\").\n",
      "\n",
      "3) BILLED_TO\n",
      "   - The customer/recipient (not the sender).\n",
      "   - Look for blocks labeled (case-insensitive): \"Bill To\", \"Billed To\", \"Invoice To\", \"Invoice to\", \"To:\", \"Customer\", \"Client\".\n",
      "   - Capture that block’s lines starting after the label and continue until a clear section break: a blank line, or the start of another major section/label (e.g., \"Description\", \"TOTAL\", \"SUBTOTAL\", \"TAX\", \"BANK\", \"Bank\", \"BANK DETAILS\", \"TERMS\", \"NOTES\", \"PAYMENT\", \"PAYMENT METHOD\", \"Pay by\", \"Due\", \"From\", \"Company\", \"Freelancer\", \"Consultant\", \"Vendor\", \"Seller\").\n",
      "   - Within the captured block, keep contact lines like \"Phone:\" / \"Email:\" if present.\n",
      "   - Explicitly exclude non-customer boilerplate lines if they appear adjacent: \"Authorized Signature\", \"Authorized Signed\", \"Signature\", \"Thank you\", \"Thank you for your business!\", slogans/taglines.\n",
      "   - Return a single string combining the block’s lines joined with \", \", trimming extra spaces/commas. If only a name is present, just return the name.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) COMPANY\n",
      "   - The issuing/seller (the party sending the invoice).\n",
      "   - Preferred sources/labels (case-insensitive): \"PAY TO\", \"Pay To\", \"From\", \"Bill From\", \"Company\", \"Company:\", \"Seller\", \"Vendor\", \"Supplier\", \"Issuer\", \"Freelancer\".\n",
      "   - Also accept role labels commonly used for the issuer: \"Consultant\", \"Contractor\", \"Designer\", \"Photographer\", \"Agency\", \"Studio\".\n",
      "   - If a \"PAY TO\" block exists with both a person and a company (e.g., person name on one line, company on the next), choose the company; otherwise use the person’s name.\n",
      "   - If no explicit label exists, use a clear brand/company name adjacent to the main INVOICE header (e.g., \"INVOICEBorcelle\" -> COMPANY = \"Borcelle\"). Do NOT use generic template titles as the company (e.g., \"Green IT Company Professional Service Invoice\", \"Consulting Invoice Template\", \"White Modern Sales Invoice\", \"Beige Elegant Professional Business Invoice\", \"INVOICE/TAX RECEIPT\", \"Consulting INVOICE\").\n",
      "   - Be robust to run-on labels (e.g., \"INVOICE TOCOMPANY:\"): treat \"COMPANY:\" as the start of the issuer block even if adjacent to other labels.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) TOTAL_AMOUNT\n",
      "   - The final amount payable.\n",
      "   - Prefer labels (case-insensitive): \"TOTAL\", \"TOTAL:\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT DUE\", \"AMOUNT DUE\", \"BALANCE DUE\", \"Grand Total\", \"TOTAL DUE\".\n",
      "   - Exclude \"SUBTOTAL\"/\"SUB-TOTAL\", \"TAX\", \"Discount\", per-line item totals, and intermediate totals.\n",
      "   - If multiple totals are present, choose the grand/final one:\n",
      "     - Prefer the amount on the same line as the total label; if not present, take the nearest following amount line.\n",
      "     - Prefer totals appearing after subtotal/tax sections when present.\n",
      "     - Handle concatenations such as \"TOTAL$1,600.00\" or \"$ 8987TOTAL\" by extracting the currency amount and normalizing the symbol-spacing (e.g., \"$1,600.00\", \"$8987\").\n",
      "   - Preserve the currency symbol and punctuation from the source (except the symbol-digit spacing normalization).\n",
      "\n",
      "6) BANK_NAME\n",
      "   - Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Bank Name\", \"Bank\".\n",
      "   - Also accept a standalone line that clearly denotes a bank name within a bank/payment section (e.g., near \"Bank\", \"Account\", \"Payment Method\", \"Bank Details\"), including lines ending with \"Bank\" like \"Rimberio Bank\".\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "7) ACCOUNT_NAME\n",
      "   - Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Account Name\", \"Account name\", \"A/C Name\", \"Account Holder\", \"Beneficiary\", \"Beneficiary Name\".\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "8) ACCOUNT_NUMBER\n",
      "   - Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Account Number\", \"Account No\", \"Account No.\", \"Acct No\", \"A/C No\", \"A/C Number\", \"Account #\", \"Bank Account\", \"Bank A/C\", \"IBAN\", \"IBAN No\", \"IBAN Number\".\n",
      "   - Preserve dashes, spaces, and letters as they appear (e.g., \"0012-3456-7890\", \"0123 4567 8901\", \"GB29 NWBK 6016 1331 9268 19\").\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional guidance and disambiguation:\n",
      "- If both billed-to and from/company blocks share the same address/email, still keep them distinct: BILLED_TO is the customer/recipient; COMPANY is the issuer/seller.\n",
      "- When capturing multi-line blocks (BILLED_TO or COMPANY/PAY TO/FROM), stop at the next clear header/section label or a blank line to avoid bleeding into unrelated sections (e.g., \"Description\", \"Terms\", \"Bank Details\", \"Payment Method\", \"Subtotal\", \"Total\").\n",
      "- Be robust to OCR issues:\n",
      "  - Detect labels embedded in words (e.g., \"INVOICEBorcelle\" -> \"INVOICE\" + \"Borcelle\"; \"INVOICE TOCOMPANY:\" -> \"INVOICE TO\" + \"COMPANY:\").\n",
      "  - Detect totals where the number and the \"TOTAL\" label run together.\n",
      "- Prefer explicit labels over inference; if no acceptable label is found for a field, leave it as \"\" rather than guessing from generic headers or decorative text.\n",
      "- Ensure the final output is valid JSON with exactly the eight required keys and no trailing commas.\n",

      "7) ACCOUNT_NAME\n",
      "   - Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Account Name\", \"Account name\", \"A/C Name\", \"Beneficiary\", \"Beneficiary Name\", \"Payee\", \"Payee Name\", \"Account Holder\", \"Recipient\", \"Name\" when clearly within a bank/payment info block.\n",
      "   - Also apply the mislabel heuristic from BANK_NAME: if \"Bank Name\" appears to hold a person’s name within a payment block (and an \"Account\"/\"Bank Account\" line is present), map that value to ACCOUNT_NAME.\n",

      "- Prefer explicit labels over inference; if no acceptable label is found for a field, return \"\" rather than guessing.\n",
      "- Recognize common date formats: e.g., MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD, DD.MM.YYYY, D Month YYYY (and similar with month names). When a line contains both a number and a date near the invoice header (e.g., \"NO. 001 02.05.2024\"), separate them accordingly.\n",

      "- When a label and value are separated by a line break, capture the nearest following non-empty value line.\n",
      "- Preserve values exactly as they appear (currency symbols, punctuation, hyphens, internal spaces), except:\n",
      "  - Normalize minor spacing in currency values: remove a space between the currency symbol and digits (e.g., \"$ 346.50\" -> \"$346.50\").\n",
      "  - For INVOICE_NUMBER, strip a single leading \"#\" if present (keep internal hyphens/prefixes like \"INV-00001\").\n",
      "- Do not reformat dates; use them exactly as written.\n",
      "- Do not compute totals; use only an explicitly labeled final total (see TOTAL_AMOUNT rules).\n",
      "- Prefer explicit labels over inference. If an acceptable label or unambiguous context is not found, leave the field as \"\" rather than guessing from unrelated text.\n",
      "\n",
      "DISAMBIGUATION FOR TWO-COLUMN LAYOUTS:\n",
      "- If \"FROM:\" and \"TO:\" both appear anywhere, treat:\n",
      "  - \"FROM:\" block as COMPANY (issuer/seller).\n",
      "  - \"TO:\" block as BILLED_TO (customer/recipient).\n",
      "- The \"FROM:\"/\"TO:\" blocks may appear in any order in the raw text due to column extraction. Assign based on the label, not position.\n",
      "- The seller/company block is often near payment/bank details; the customer block rarely contains bank details. Use this to break ties if labels are missing.\n",
      "\n",
      "BLOCK CAPTURE AND STOP CONDITIONS:\n",
      "- When capturing multi-line blocks (BILLED_TO or COMPANY/PAY TO/FROM), include contiguous lines until a clear section break:\n",
      "  - A blank line; or\n",
      "  - The start of another major section/label such as: Description/Item/Qty/Rate/Amount/Subtotal/Tax/Discount/Total/Balance/Bank/Account/Terms/Notes/Payment/Pay To/From/Freelancer/Company/Customer/Client/Invoice/No./NO./Date/DATE.\n",
      "- Join the block’s lines with \", \" and trim redundant spaces/commas.\n",
      "- Inside blocks:\n",
      "  - Drop leading role labels on name lines such as \"Bill To:\", \"Billed To:\", \"Invoice To:\", \"To:\", \"Customer:\", \"Client:\", \"From:\", \"FROM:\", \"PAY TO:\" when they prefix the name on the same line. Keep the value after the colon.\n",
      "  - Keep contact field prefixes like \"Phone:\", \"Email:\", \"CODE:\", \"Address:\" if they appear.\n",
      "\n",
      "FIELD-SPECIFIC RULES AND ROBUST LABEL VARIANTS:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) INVOICE_NUMBER\n",
      "   - Accept labels/contexts (case-insensitive): \"Invoice Number\", \"Invoice No\", \"Invoice No.\", \"Invoice NO.\", \"Invoice #\", \"INVOICE NO.\", \"INVOICE NO\", \"INV#\", \"Invoice ID\", \"No.\", \"NO.\", \"No\", \"NO\".\n",
      "   - Also accept a standalone number prefixed with \"#\" near the main invoice header (e.g., under/near a line with \"INVOICE\" or \"INVOICE/TAX RECEIPT\").\n",
      "   - Values may be on the same line as the label or the next non-empty line.\n",
      "   - Special pattern: If a line contains a number label with both a number and a date (e.g., \"NO. 001 02.05.2024\"), treat the first numeric token as INVOICE_NUMBER and the date-like token as INVOICE_DATE (see date patterns below).\n",
      "   - Strip a single leading \"#\" from the captured value; preserve other punctuation/hyphens (e.g., \"INV-00008\", \"2000-15\", \"001\").\n",
      "\n",
      "2) INVOICE_DATE\n",
      "   - Prefer labels (in this order): \"Invoice Date\", \"Date of Issue\", \"Issue Date\", \"Date Issued\", \"Date\".\n",
      "   - If both a generic \"Date\" and a more specific \"Invoice Date\"/\"Date of Issue\"/\"Issue Date\" appear, prefer the specific one tied to the invoice.\n",
      "   - Exclude non-issue dates: \"Service Date\", \"Due Date\", \"Payment Due\", \"Delivery Date\", \"Ship Date\", \"Expiration Date\".\n",
      "   - Accept the special combined-number line pattern: if a line like \"NO. 001 02.05.2024\" or \"Invoice No. 001 02/05/2024\" contains a clear date token (e.g., dd.mm.yyyy, dd/mm/yyyy, yyyy-mm-dd, \"5 December 2030\"), assign that token to INVOICE_DATE.\n",
      "   - If \"DATE\" appears as a standalone layout header without a date on the same line or the immediate next line, ignore it.\n",
      "   - If no specific label is present but there is a single standalone date clearly associated with the main invoice header/number area, use it.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) BILLED_TO\n",
      "   - The customer/recipient (not the sender).\n",
      "   - Look for blocks labeled: \"Bill To\", \"Billed To\", \"Invoice To\", \"Invoice to\", \"To:\", \"TO:\", \"Customer\", \"Client\", \"Ship To\".\n",
      "   - If \"FROM:\" and \"TO:\" both exist, use the \"TO:\" block as BILLED_TO (regardless of order).\n",
      "   - Build the block as described above. On the first line, remove the role label prefix and colon if present (e.g., \"Customer: Build It Right\" -> \"Build It Right\"). Keep phone/email/etc. labels elsewhere in the block.\n",
      "   - Stop at the next clear header/section label or blank line.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) COMPANY\n",
      "   - The issuing/seller (the party sending the invoice).\n",
      "   - Preferred sources/labels: \"From\", \"FROM:\", \"Company\", \"Seller\", \"Vendor\", \"Supplier\", \"Issuer\", \"PAY TO\", \"Freelancer\".\n",
      "   - If a \"PAY TO\" block exists, extract the entity there; if both a person and a company are listed (e.g., a person name and a company name on adjacent lines), choose the company; otherwise use the person’s name.\n",
      "   - If \"FROM:\" and \"TO:\" both exist, use the \"FROM:\" block as COMPANY.\n",
      "   - Do NOT use generic template titles as the company (e.g., \"Freelance Invoice Template\", \"White Modern Sales Invoice\", \"Green Blue Pink Vintage Retro Freelance Invoice\", \"INVOICE\", \"INVOICE/TAX RECEIPT\").\n",
      "   - If no explicit seller/company can be identified, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "5) TOTAL_AMOUNT\n",
      "   - The final amount payable.\n",
      "   - Accept labels: \"TOTAL\", \"TOTAL:\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT DUE\", \"AMOUNT DUE\", \"BALANCE DUE\", \"Grand Total\".\n",
      "   - Exclude: \"SUBTOTAL\"/\"SUB-TOTAL\"/\"SUB TOTAL\", \"TAX\", \"VAT\", \"S&H\", \"Shipping\", \"Discount\", \"Deposit\", per-line item totals, and intermediate totals.\n",
      "   - Selection rules when multiple amounts are present:\n",
      "     - Prefer the amount on the same line as the total label; if not present, take the nearest following amount line (the next non-empty line with a currency amount).\n",
      "     - Prefer totals appearing after subtotal/tax sections.\n",
      "     - If a \"TOTAL\" label is present in a summary area with multiple amounts, choose the amount closest to that label (same line or next non-empty line), not the largest number in the document.\n",
      "   - If no clearly labeled final total can be associated (e.g., \"TOTAL AMOUNT\" appears but no nearby amount is provided within the next 2 non-empty lines), leave TOTAL_AMOUNT as \"\" rather than taking a line-item amount.\n",
      "   - Normalize currency spacing (e.g., \"TOTAL $ 3045.60\" -> \"$3045.60\").\n",
      "\n",
      "6) BANK_NAME\n",
      "   - Value following labels: \"Bank Name\", \"Bank\", \"BANK NAME\".\n",
      "   - Value may be on the same line or the next non-empty line.\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "7) ACCOUNT_NAME\n",
      "   - Value following labels: \"Account Name\", \"Account name\", \"A/C Name\", \"Account Holder\", \"Beneficiary\", \"Beneficiary Name\".\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "8) ACCOUNT_NUMBER\n",
      "   - Value following labels: \"Account Number\", \"Account No\", \"Account No.\", \"Acct No\", \"Acct No.\", \"A/C No\", \"A/C Number\", \"ACC No\", \"Acc No\", \"ACC#\", \"Acc:\", \"Acc. No\".\n",
      "   - Preserve dashes and spaces exactly as they appear (e.g., \"0012-3456-7890\", \"0123 4567 8901\").\n",
      "   - If both an IBAN and a local account number are present, prefer the value explicitly tied to the above account-number labels; otherwise leave blank if ambiguous.\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "ADDITIONAL TIPS:\n",
      "- When multiple candidate blocks exist for BILLED_TO/COMPANY, prefer the one explicitly labeled. If neither is labeled, the block near bank/payment details is likely the seller; the other is likely the customer.\n",
      "- Avoid pulling values from generic headers, footers, or decorative/template text.\n",
      "- Ensure the final output uses double quotes and is valid JSON. Example of correct quoting and formatting:\n",

      "- Do not output a Python dict (no single quotes). Must be valid JSON.\n",
      "\n",
      "GENERAL PARSING STRATEGY:\n",

      "- Values may appear on the same line after \":\" or similar, or on the nearest following non-empty line.\n",
      "- Support two-column or stacked layouts: if you see a stack of labels and then a stack of lines starting with \":\" (or clearly values), pair them in order (e.g., \"Bank / Name / Account\" aligned to \": Fauget Bank / : Pedro Fernandez / : 0123 4567 8901\").\n",
      "- When a label and its value are separated by a line break, capture the nearest following non-empty value line.\n",
      "- For multi-line blocks (BILLED_TO or PAY TO/FROM), include contiguous lines until a clear break: a blank line or the start of another major section/label (e.g., \"Description\", \"ITEMS\", \"Subtotal\", \"TOTAL\", \"BANK\", \"BANK DETAILS\", \"Payment\", \"PAYMENT METHOD\", \"TERMS\", \"NOTES\", \"THANK YOU\", \"PAY TO\", \"From\", \"Freelancer\", \"Company\").\n",
      "- For contact blocks that merged from two columns and created duplicate adjacent lines (e.g., duplicate address or email lines), eliminate consecutive duplicates while preserving order.\n",
      "\n",
      "CRITICAL DISAMBIGUATION HEURISTICS AND EDGE-CASE HANDLING:\n",
      "\n",
      "A) INVOICE_NUMBER\n",
      "- Labels to match (case-insensitive): \"Invoice Number\", \"Invoice No\", \"Invoice No.\", \"Invoice NO.\", \"INVOICE NO.\", \"INVOICE NO\", \"Invoice #\", \"INV#\", \"Invoice ID\".\n",
      "- Also accept a standalone number prefixed with \"#\" near the main INVOICE header.\n",

      "\n",
      "B) INVOICE_DATE\n",
      "- Prefer labels in this order (case-insensitive): \"Invoice Date\", \"Date of Issue\", \"DATE OF ISSUE\", \"Issue Date\", \"Date Issued\", \"Date\", \"DATE\".\n",
      "- Explicitly exclude non-issue dates: \"Service Date\", \"Due Date\", \"Payment Due\", \"Delivery Date\", \"DUE DATE\", \"SERVICE DATE\".\n",
      "- If both a general \"Date\" and a more specific invoice date label exist, use the specific one tied to the invoice.\n",
      "- If no label is present but there is a single standalone date clearly associated with the invoice header/summary, use it.\n",
      "- If a date string has an appended artifact due to layout (e.g., \"...2025INVOICE\"), keep only the date substring.\n",
      "\n",
      "C) BILLED_TO (customer/recipient, not the sender)\n",
      "- Labels to match (case-insensitive): \"Bill To\", \"Billed To\", \"Invoice To\", \"Invoice to\", \"To:\", \"Customer\", \"Client\", \"Issued To\", \"ISSUED TO\".\n",
      "- Capture all lines in that block until a clear break as defined above. Join with \", \".\n",
      "- Keep inline labels like \"Phone:\" or \"Email:\" if they appear inside the billed-to block.\n",
      "- If both \"BILL TO\" and \"FROM\"/\"PAY TO\" appear but the lines immediately after those labels are empty because of layout, search ahead for two distinct contact blocks (names/addresses/emails). Map them as follows:\n",
      "  - First, try to pair by proximity to the earlier labels if the blocks clearly follow in order (first block → first label, second block → second label).\n",
      "  - If proximity is ambiguous or interleaved, prefer assigning a company-like entity (contains \"Inc\", \"LLC\", \"Ltd\", \"Co.\", or appears fully uppercased as a legal name) to COMPANY (the sender), and the person-like name to BILLED_TO.\n",
      "  - If the same address/email appears in both blocks due to layout merging, still keep them distinct per their labels; deduplicate adjacent duplicates within each block.\n",

      "- If no explicit seller/company block is present but a \"BANK DETAILS\"/payment section begins with a standalone name-like line before bank labels (e.g., a brand like \"AveryDavis\"), and no other credible COMPANY is found, use that line as COMPANY.\n",
      "- Ignore generic/template titles (e.g., \"Freelance Invoice Template\", \"INVOICE\", \"INVOICE/TAX RECEIPT\", \"Green IT Company Professional Service Invoice\").\n",
      "- If multiple variants of the same company name appear (e.g., \"Wardiere Inc.\" and \"WARDIERE INC.\"), prefer the fully uppercased legal-name line when present; otherwise choose the line closest to the COMPANY label.\n",

      "- When multiple candidates exist:\n",
      "  - Prefer the summary area that typically lists \"Subtotal\", \"Tax\", \"Discount\", etc., and comes after the line-item table.\n",
      "  - Avoid amounts tied to table headers like \"Total Amount\" when it appears alongside column headers (\"Description\", \"Quantity\", \"Unit Price\", \"Amount\", \"Total\", \"Total Amount\").\n",
      "  - If both a \"Total Amount\" earlier in the items section and a \"Total\"/\"Grand Total\"/\"Amount Due\" later in a summary exist, choose the later summary total.\n",
      "  - Prefer the amount on the same line as the total label; if not present, take the nearest following amount in the summary block (skip non-amount lines like \"10%\" or \"Tax Rate\").\n",
      "  - If multiple summary totals exist, choose the most specific label (\"AMOUNT DUE\" > \"TOTAL AMOUNT\" > \"TOTAL\"/\"Grand Total\"); when equal specificity, choose the last one in reading order within the summary.\n",

      "- Preserve dashes and spaces exactly (e.g., \"0012-3456-7890\", \"0123 4567 8901\").\n",
      "- Support two-column/stacked layouts.\n",
      "\n",

      "  - For INVOICE_NUMBER, strip a leading \"#\" symbol if present (keep internal hyphens like \"INV-00001\").\n",
      "- Do not reformat dates; use them exactly as written.\n",
      "- Do not compute totals; use only the explicitly labeled final total.\n",
      "- Trim leading/trailing whitespace from all extracted values.\n",
      "\n",
      "General parsing approach:\n",
      "- Treat the input as a sequence of lines. Use case-insensitive label matching, but extract values in original casing.\n",
      "- A label and its value may be on the same line (e.g., \"Bank Name: ABC Bank\") or on consecutive lines (e.g., \"TOTAL\" on one line, amount on the next). Capture the nearest following non-empty value line when split across lines.\n",
      "- Ignore decorative/tagline/template text that is not a labeled field (e.g., \"Meet All Your Needs\", \"Thank you for your business!\", \"Professional Service Invoice\", \"Invoice\", \"INVOICE/TAX RECEIPT\", color/theme names).\n",
      "\n",
      "Field-specific rules and robust label variants:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) INVOICE_NUMBER\n",
      "   - Labels to match (case-insensitive): \"Invoice Number\", \"Invoice No\", \"Invoice No.\", \"Invoice NO.\", \"Invoice #\", \"INVOICE NO.\", \"INVOICE NO\", \"INV#\", \"Invoice ID\", \"Invoice#\".\n",
      "   - Also accept a standalone number prefixed with \"#\" near the main invoice header (e.g., under/next to a prominent \"INVOICE\" header).\n",
      "   - Capture the adjacent value on the same line or the next line.\n",
      "   - Strip a leading \"#\" from the captured value; preserve other punctuation/hyphens (e.g., \"INV-00008\", \"2000-15\", \"001\").\n",
      "   - If multiple candidates exist, prefer the one closest to the main invoice header or explicitly labeled as above.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) INVOICE_DATE\n",
      "   - Labels to match (preference order): \"Invoice Date\", \"Date of Issue\", \"Issue Date\", \"Date Issued\", \"Date\".\n",
      "   - Prefer the specific invoice date label over a generic \"Date\".\n",
      "   - Exclude non-issuing dates such as \"Service Date\", \"Due Date\", \"Payment Due\", \"Pay by\", \"Delivery Date\".\n",
      "   - If no explicit label exists but there is a single standalone date clearly associated with the invoice header, use it (avoid dates in payment/terms sections).\n",
      "   - Keep the format exactly as written (e.g., \"15/08/2028\", \"01 / 02 / 2023\", \"12.06.2024\").\n",
      "\n",
      "3) BILLED_TO\n",
      "   - The customer/recipient (not the sender).\n",
      "   - Labels to match (case-insensitive): \"Bill To\", \"Billed To\", \"Invoice To\", \"Invoice to\", \"To:\", \"Customer\", \"Client\".\n",
      "   - Capture that block’s lines until a clear section break: a blank line, or the start of another major section/label (e.g., \"Description\", \"Item\", \"TOTAL\", \"SUBTOTAL\", \"TAX\", \"BANK\", \"Bank\", \"Bank Details\", \"TERMS\", \"NOTES\", \"PAY TO\", \"From\", \"Freelancer\", \"Company\", \"Invoice #\", \"Invoice No\", \"INVOICE NO\", \"Date\", \"Due Date\", \"Payment Method\", \"PAYMENT METHOD\", \"Authorized Signature\", \"Authorized Signed\", \"Pay by\").\n",
      "   - Return a single string combining the block’s lines joined with \", \". Trim extra spaces/commas. Keep labels like \"Phone:\"/\"Email:\" if they appear inside the billed-to block.\n",
      "   - Do not include unrelated boilerplate (e.g., \"Thank you for your business!\", \"Authorized Signed\").\n",
      "\n",
      "4) COMPANY\n",
      "   - The issuing/seller (the party sending the invoice).\n",
      "   - Preferred sources/labels (case-insensitive): \"From\", \"Company\", \"Seller\", \"Vendor\", \"Supplier\", \"Issuer\", \"PAY TO\", \"Pay To\", \"Freelancer\".\n",
      "   - If a \"PAY TO\" block exists, extract the entity from there; if both a person and a company are listed (e.g., a personal name and a company like \"Wardi LLC\"), choose the company (\"Wardi LLC\"); otherwise use the person’s name.\n",
      "   - Do NOT infer the company from decorative/template headers or themes (e.g., \"Green IT Company Professional Service Invoice\", \"Freelance Invoice Template\", \"White Modern Sales Invoice\", \"Beige Elegant Professional Business Invoice\", \"Meet All Your Needs\", brand/taglines).\n",
      "   - If no explicit seller/company block can be identified via the labels above, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "5) TOTAL_AMOUNT\n",
      "   - The final amount payable (grand/final total).\n",
      "   - Prefer labels (case-insensitive): \"TOTAL\", \"TOTAL:\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT DUE\", \"AMOUNT DUE\", \"BALANCE DUE\", \"Grand Total\".\n",
      "   - Exclude \"SUBTOTAL\"/\"SUB-TOTAL\", \"TAX\", \"Tax Rate\", \"Discount\", per-line item totals, and intermediate totals.\n",
      "   - Selection rules when multiple totals exist:\n",
      "     - Prefer the amount directly on the same line as the total label; if not present, take the nearest following non-empty amount line.\n",
      "     - Prefer totals that appear after any subtotal/tax/discount sections (end-of-invoice summary area).\n",
      "     - If a \"TOTAL\" label with no adjacent amount is followed immediately by unrelated headers/sections, fall back to the closest explicit grand-total-style label in the summary area (e.g., \"TOTAL AMOUNT\", \"AMOUNT DUE\") rather than picking the largest amount.\n",
      "   - Preserve the currency symbol and punctuation; normalize spacing between currency symbol and digits if needed (e.g., \"$ 550\" -> \"$550\").\n",
      "\n",
      "6) BANK_NAME\n",
      "   - Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Bank Name\", \"Bank\".\n",
      "   - Accept either \"Bank Name: XYZ\" or a lone \"Bank\" line followed by the bank name on the next line.\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "7) ACCOUNT_NAME\n",
      "   - Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Account Name\", \"Account name\", \"A/C Name\".\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "8) ACCOUNT_NUMBER\n",
      "   - Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Account Number\", \"Account No\", \"Account No.\", \"Acct No\", \"A/C No\", \"A/C Number\".\n",
      "   - Preserve dashes and spaces as they appear (e.g., \"0012-3456-7890\", \"0123 4567 8901\").\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional guidance and disambiguation:\n",
      "- When capturing multi-line blocks (BILLED_TO or PAY TO/FROM), stop at the next clear header/section label or a blank line to avoid bleeding into unrelated sections (e.g., \"Description\", \"Terms\", \"Bank Details\", \"Payment Method\", \"Authorized Signed\", \"Thank you\").\n",
      "- If both billed-to and from/company blocks share the same address/email, still keep them distinct: BILLED_TO is the customer/recipient; COMPANY is the issuer/seller.\n",
      "- Prefer explicit labels over inference; if no acceptable label is found for a field, leave it as \"\" rather than guessing from a generic header.\n",
      "- Avoid using standalone brand words near \"INVOICE\" (e.g., \"INVOICEBorcelle\") as COMPANY unless they appear within a labeled \"From\"/\"PAY TO\"/company block.\n",
      "- Ensure the final output is valid JSON with exactly the eight required keys, double-quoted strings, and no trailing commas.\n",

      "  - No extra text, no rationale, no surrounding prose.\n",

      "- A value may be on the same line as its label (after “:”, “-”, or similar) or on the nearest following non-empty line.\n",
      "- Handle two-column/stacked layouts: if you see a vertical stack of labels followed by a parallel stack of lines starting with “:” holding values, pair them in order (e.g., “Bank / Name / Account” aligned to “: Borcelle Bank / : Margarita Perez / : 0123 4567 8901”).\n",
      "- When a label and its value are broken by a line break, capture the nearest following non-empty line as the value.\n",
      "- Prefer explicit labels over inference; if no acceptable label exists for a field, return \"\" rather than guessing.\n",
      "- Stop multi-line block captures at a clear section break: a blank line or the start of another major section/label (e.g., “Description”, “TOTAL”, “Bank Details”, “Payment Information”, “Terms”, “PAY TO”, “From”, “Freelancer”, “Company”).\n",

      "\n",
      "Normalization rules:\n",
      "- Currency spacing: remove any space between the currency symbol and the amount digits (e.g., “$ 346.50” -> “$346.50”, “€ 1,200.00” -> “€1,200.00”).\n",
      "- INVOICE_NUMBER: strip a single leading “#” if present (preserve internal hyphens and other punctuation).\n",
      "- If a date line is stuck to other words due to layout (e.g., “23 March 2025INVOICE”), keep only the plausible date substring and drop the trailing artifact.\n",
      "- Preserve leading zeros in account numbers and any internal spaces/dashes exactly as written.\n",
      "\n",
      "Field-specific rules and label variants:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) INVOICE_NUMBER\n",
      "   - Labels to accept (case-insensitive): “Invoice Number”, “Invoice No”, “Invoice No.”, “Invoice NO.”, “INVOICE NO.”, “INVOICE NO”, “Invoice #”, “INV#”, “Invoice ID”.\n",
      "   - Also accept a standalone number prefixed with “#” that appears adjacent to the main invoice header (e.g., under/beside “INVOICE”).\n",
      "   - Capture value on the same line or the next non-empty line.\n",
      "   - After capture, strip exactly one leading “#”.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) INVOICE_DATE\n",
      "   - Prefer labels in this order (case-insensitive): “Invoice Date”, “Date of Issue”, “Issue Date”, “Date Issued”, “Date”.\n",
      "   - Exclude non-issue dates such as “Service Date”, “Due Date”, “Payment Due”, “Delivery Date”, etc.\n",
      "   - If both a generic “Date” and a more specific invoice date exist, choose the specific invoice date.\n",
      "   - If no label is present but there is a single clear standalone date near the invoice header/summary, use it.\n",
      "   - Keep the original date format; if merged with artifacts (e.g., “INVOICE” stuck), keep only the date substring.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) BILLED_TO\n",
      "   - The recipient/customer (not the sender).\n",
      "   - Labels to match (case-insensitive): “Bill To”, “Billed To”, “Invoice To”, “Invoice to”, “To:”, “Customer”, “Client”.\n",
      "   - Capture contiguous lines in this block until a clear break (blank line or start of another major section).\n",
      "   - Return a single string by joining the captured lines with “, ”.\n",
      "   - Keep inline sublabels like “Phone:” and “Email:” if they appear within this block.\n",
      "   - Do not include the label text itself (e.g., don’t prefix with “Customer:”).\n",
      "\n",
      "4) COMPANY\n",
      "   - The issuing/selling party (sender).\n",
      "   - Preferred sources/labels (case-insensitive): “From”, “Company”, “Seller”, “Vendor”, “Supplier”, “Issuer”, “PAY TO”, “Payable to”, “Freelancer”.\n",
      "   - If a “PAY TO” or “Payable to” block exists, extract the entity from there; if both a person and a company are given (e.g., a name and “LLC”), choose the company entity; otherwise use the person’s name.\n",
      "   - “Freelancer: Name” may be used if no better company label exists.\n",
      "   - Do NOT infer COMPANY from job-role labels like “Consultant:”, “Gardener:”, or similar unless they appear inside an explicit sender block (e.g., under “From”, “PAY TO”, etc.).\n",
      "   - Do NOT use generic/template titles as the company (e.g., “INVOICE”, “Freelance Invoice Template”, “Consulting Invoice Template”, etc.).\n",
      "   - If no acceptable sender/company block/label is found, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "5) TOTAL_AMOUNT\n",
      "   - The final amount payable (grand total).\n",
      "   - Prefer labels (case-insensitive): “TOTAL”, “TOTAL:”, “TOTAL AMOUNT”, “TOTAL AMOUNT DUE”, “AMOUNT DUE”, “BALANCE DUE”, “Grand Total”.\n",
      "   - Exclude intermediate figures like “SUBTOTAL”/“SUB-TOTAL”, “TAX”, “Discount”, and line-item amounts.\n",
      "   - If multiple totals exist, choose the grand/final one:\n",
      "     - Prefer the amount on the same line as the total label; otherwise take the closest following amount line.\n",
      "     - Prefer totals appearing after subtotal/tax sections when present.\n",
      "     - When a summary lists multiple labeled amounts, choose the one tied to the most specific total label (“TOTAL AMOUNT DUE” > “TOTAL”).\n",
      "   - Normalize currency spacing as described above; preserve the currency symbol and punctuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) BANK_NAME\n",
      "   - Value following labels (case-insensitive): “Bank Name”, “Bank”.\n",
      "   - Support two-column/stacked mapping as described.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) ACCOUNT_NAME\n",
      "   - Value following labels (case-insensitive): “Account Name”, “Account name”, “A/C Name”, or “Name” when clearly inside a bank/payment info block.\n",
      "   - Support two-column/stacked mapping.\n",
      "\n",
      "8) ACCOUNT_NUMBER\n",
      "   - Value following labels (case-insensitive): “Account Number”, “Account No”, “Account No.”, “Acct No”, “A/C No”, “A/C Number”, or “Account” when clearly meaning the account number within a bank/payment info block.\n",
      "   - Preserve any spaces/dashes and leading zeros exactly as shown.\n",
      "   - Support two-column/stacked mapping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional disambiguation and block handling:\n",
      "- Keep billed-to and company distinct even if they share similar addresses/emails; respect their labels/sections.\n",
      "- Common section breaks to stop multi-line captures: “Description”, “ITEMS”, “TOTAL”, “Subtotal”, “Tax”, “Bank Details”, “Payment Information”, “Terms & Conditions”, “Notes”, “PAY TO”, “From”, “Freelancer”, “Company”.\n",
      "- For amounts under a “TOTAL …” header where the number appears on the next line, pick that next-line amount.\n",
      "- Do not pull company or bank details from unrelated headers or decorative/template text.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final validation checklist before returning:\n",
      "- Exactly eight keys present: INVOICE_NUMBER, INVOICE_DATE, BILLED_TO, COMPANY, TOTAL_AMOUNT, BANK_NAME, ACCOUNT_NAME, ACCOUNT_NUMBER.\n",
      "- All values are strings (quoted with double quotes).\n",
      "- JSON is syntactically valid (no single quotes, no trailing commas).\n",
      "- Currency spacing normalized; invoice number leading “#” removed if present.\n",

      "\n",
      "3) BILLED_TO\n",
      "   - This is the customer/recipient (not the sender).\n",

      "     - If a \"TOTAL\" label has no adjacent amount and is immediately followed by unrelated headers/sections, fall back to the closest explicit grand-total-style label in the summary area (e.g., \"TOTAL AMOUNT\", \"AMOUNT DUE\"). Do not pick a number purely because it is largest.\n",

      "6) BANK_NAME\n",
      "   - Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Bank Name\", or \"Bank\" when used as a label.\n",
      "   - Accept \"Bank Name: XYZ\" or a lone \"Bank\" line followed by the bank name on the next line.\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "7) ACCOUNT_NAME\n",

      "   - Preserve dashes and spaces as they appear (e.g., \"0012-3456-7890\", \"0123 4567 8901\").\n",
      "   - Do NOT use \"Bank Account\" or plain \"Account\" as a substitute label unless it explicitly includes \"No\", \"Number\", or \"#\".\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional guidance and disambiguation:\n",
      "- When capturing multi-line blocks (BILLED_TO or PAY TO/FROM), stop at the next clear header/section label or a blank line to avoid bleeding into unrelated sections (e.g., \"Description\", \"Terms\", \"Bank Details\", \"Payment Method\", \"Authorized Signed\", \"Thank you\", \"Date\").\n",
      "- If both billed-to and from/company blocks share the same address/email, still keep them distinct: BILLED_TO is the customer/recipient; COMPANY is the issuer/seller.\n",
      "- Prefer explicit labels over inference; if no acceptable label is found for a field, output \"\" rather than guessing from a generic header.\n",
      "- Avoid using standalone brand words near \"INVOICE\" (e.g., \"INVOICEBorcelle\") as COMPANY unless they appear within a labeled \"From\"/\"PAY TO\"/company block.\n",
      "- Tie-breakers:\n",
      "  - For INVOICE_NUMBER, if both a generic \"No:\" value and an explicit \"Invoice No.\" value exist, use the explicit \"Invoice No.\" value.\n",
      "  - For TOTAL_AMOUNT, if both \"TOTAL\" adjacent to the item summary and a separate large \"TOTAL DUE\" amount appear elsewhere, choose the amount that is with the itemized summary (subtotal/tax/discount context).\n",

      "\n",
      "Field-specific rules and robust label variants:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) INVOICE_NUMBER\n",
      "   - Accept labels (case-insensitive): \"Invoice Number\", \"Invoice No\", \"Invoice No.\", \"Invoice NO.\", \"Invoice #\", \"INVOICE NO.\", \"INVOICE NO\", \"INV#\", \"Invoice ID\", \"Invoice#\", \"INV No\", \"INV No.\", and generic \"No\", \"No.\", \"No:\" when clearly associated with the invoice header/metadata (near \"INVOICE\"/\"PROFORMA INVOICE\").\n",
      "   - Also accept a standalone number prefixed with \"#\" near the main INVOICE header.\n",
      "   - Capture the value on the same line or the next non-empty line.\n",
      "   - Strip a leading \"#\" from the captured value; preserve other punctuation/hyphens (e.g., \"INV-00008\", \"2000-15\", \"001\").\n",
      "   - If multiple candidates exist, prefer the one explicitly labeled with \"Invoice ...\"; otherwise choose the one closest to the main invoice header.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) INVOICE_DATE\n",
      "   - Preferred labels (highest to lowest): \"Invoice Date\", \"Date of Issue\", \"Issue Date\", \"Date Issued\", \"Date\".\n",
      "   - If using the generic \"Date\", ensure it is not inside the BILLED_TO/customer block; prefer the date in the header/summary metadata.\n",
      "   - Exclude non-issuing dates: \"Service Date\", \"Due Date\", \"Payment Due\", \"Pay by\", \"Delivery Date\".\n",
      "   - If label and value are on separate lines, capture the next non-empty line.\n",
      "   - Keep the format exactly as written (e.g., \"15/08/2028\", \"02/05/2021\", \"11.02.2030\").\n",
      "\n",
      "3) BILLED_TO\n",
      "   - The customer/recipient (not the sender).\n",
      "   - Labels to match (case-insensitive): \"Bill To\", \"Billed To\", \"Invoice To\", \"Invoice to\", \"To:\", \"Customer\", \"Client\", \"INVOICE TO\".\n",
      "   - Capture that block’s lines until a clear section break: a blank line, or the start of another major section/label. Treat the following as breaks (case-insensitive): \"Description\", \"Item\", \"PRODUCT\", \"UNIT PRICE\", \"QTY\", \"TOTAL\", \"TOTAL DUE\", \"SUBTOTAL\", \"SUB-TOTAL\", \"TAX\", \"TAX RATE\", \"DISCOUNT\", \"BANK\", \"Bank\", \"Bank Details\", \"PAY TO\", \"From\", \"Freelancer\", \"Company\", \"Invoice #\", \"Invoice No\", \"INVOICE NO\", \"DATE\", \"Invoice Date\", \"Due Date\", \"Payment Method\", \"PAYMENT METHOD\", \"Authorized Signature\", \"Authorized Signed\", \"Pay by\", \"Terms\", \"Notes\", \"THANK YOU\".\n",
      "   - Important: stop the BILLED_TO block at any \"Date\"/\"Invoice Date\"/\"Date of Issue\" line; do not include date lines inside BILLED_TO.\n",
      "   - Return a single string combining the block’s lines joined with \", \". Preserve internal labels like \"Phone:\"/\"Email:\" if present.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) COMPANY\n",
      "   - The issuing/seller (the party sending the invoice).\n",
      "   - Preferred sources/labels (case-insensitive): \"From\", \"Company\", \"Seller\", \"Vendor\", \"Supplier\", \"Issuer\", \"PAY TO\", \"Pay To\", \"Freelancer\", \"Service Provider\".\n",
      "   - If a \"PAY TO\" block exists, extract the entity from there; if both a person and a company are listed (e.g., a personal name and a company like \"Liceria & Co.\", \"Wardi LLC\"), choose the company; otherwise use the person’s name.\n",
      "   - Do NOT infer the company from decorative/theme headers (e.g., \"Green IT Company Professional Service Invoice\").\n",
      "   - If no explicit seller/company block can be identified via the labels above, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "5) TOTAL_AMOUNT\n",
      "   - The final amount payable (grand/final total).\n",
      "   - Prefer explicit grand-total labels (case-insensitive): \"TOTAL\", \"TOTAL:\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT DUE\", \"AMOUNT DUE\", \"BALANCE DUE\", \"Grand Total\", \"TOTAL DUE\".\n",
      "   - Exclude \"SUBTOTAL\"/\"SUB-TOTAL\", \"TAX\", \"Tax Rate\", \"Discount\", per-line item totals, and intermediate totals.\n",
      "   - Selection rules when multiple candidates exist:\n",
      "     - The amount should appear on the same line as the grand-total label; if not, take the nearest following non-empty amount line.\n",
      "     - Prefer totals in the end-of-invoice summary area directly adjacent to/after any subtotal/tax/discount lines (the itemized summary).\n",
      "     - If multiple grand-total-style labels exist (e.g., both \"TOTAL\" and \"TOTAL DUE\"), choose the amount that appears with or immediately following the subtotal/tax/discount block rather than a standalone header.\n",
      "   - Normalize spacing between any currency symbol and digits if needed (e.g., \"$ 550\" -> \"$550\").\n",
      "\n",
      "6) BANK_NAME\n",
      "   - Primary rule: capture value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Bank Name\", or \"Bank\" when used as a label. Accept \"Bank Name: XYZ\" or a lone \"Bank\" line followed by the bank name on the next line.\n",
      "   - If the \"Bank:\" label is followed by a numeric-looking value (digits/spaces/dashes), treat that as part of account details (not a bank name).\n",
      "   - If within a \"PAY TO\"/\"Bank Details\" section there is a standalone line that clearly looks like a bank name (e.g., ends with \"Bank\", \"Bank Ltd\", \"Bank PLC\") and is adjacent to account details, you may use that line as BANK_NAME even if not explicitly labeled.\n",
      "   - Do not use \"Bank Code\", \"Bank ID\", \"Bank Swift\" as BANK_NAME.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) ACCOUNT_NAME\n",
      "   - Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Account Name\", \"Account name\", \"A/C Name\".\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "8) ACCOUNT_NUMBER\n",
      "   - Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Account Number\", \"Account No\", \"Account No.\", \"Acct No\", \"Acct No.\", \"Account #\", \"Acct #\", \"A/C No\", \"A/C No.\", \"A/C Number\", \"A/C #\".\n",
      "   - Preserve dashes and spaces as they appear (e.g., \"0012-3456-7890\", \"0123 4567 8901\").\n",
      "   - Do NOT use \"Bank Account\" or plain \"Account\" as a substitute label unless it explicitly includes \"No\", \"Number\", or \"#\".\n",
      "   - Handle value-before-label pattern: if a plausible account number (digits/spaces/dashes) appears immediately above an \"Account No\"/\"Account Number\"/\"A/C No\" line that has no value on the same line, capture that preceding number as ACCOUNT_NUMBER.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional guidance and disambiguation:\n",
      "- When capturing multi-line blocks (BILLED_TO or PAY TO/FROM), stop at the next clear header/section label or a blank line to avoid bleeding into unrelated sections (e.g., \"Description\", \"Terms\", \"Bank Details\", \"Payment Method\", \"Authorized Signed\", \"Thank you\", \"Date\").\n",
      "- If both billed-to and from/company blocks share the same address/email, still keep them distinct: BILLED_TO is the customer/recipient; COMPANY is the issuer/seller.\n",
      "- Tie-breakers:\n",
      "  - For INVOICE_NUMBER, if both a generic \"No:\" value and an explicit \"Invoice No.\" value exist, use the explicit \"Invoice ...\".\n",
      "  - For TOTAL_AMOUNT, if both \"TOTAL\" adjacent to the item summary and a separate large \"TOTAL DUE\" appear elsewhere, choose the one with the itemized summary.\n",
      "- Never include any explanation or additional keys. Output exactly one JSON object with the eight required keys using double-quoted strings only.\n",

      "  - If multiple grand-total-style labels exist (e.g., both \"TOTAL\" and \"TOTAL DUE\"), choose the one positioned with or immediately following the subtotal/tax/discount block rather than a standalone or decorative header elsewhere.\n",
      "  - If a \"TOTAL\" label is present without an adjacent amount and is immediately followed by unrelated headers/sections, fall back to the closest explicit grand-total-style label in the summary area.\n",

      "- For INVOICE_NUMBER: if both a generic \"No:\" and an explicit \"Invoice No.\" exist, use the explicit \"Invoice ...\" value.\n",
      "- For INVOICE_DATE: prefer dedicated invoice date labels over a generic \"Date\". Do not use \"Service Date\" or \"Due Date\".\n",
      "- For TOTAL_AMOUNT: if both \"TOTAL\" adjacent to the item summary and a separate large \"TOTAL DUE\" amount appear elsewhere, choose the amount that is with the itemized summary (subtotal/tax/discount context).\n",
      "- Prefer explicitly labeled values over inference. If no acceptable label exists for a field, output \"\" rather than guessing.\n",
      "\n",

      "- If both a general \"Date\" and a more specific variant appear, use the more specific one tied to the invoice.\n",
      "- Important: If a \"Date\" appears inside the BILLED_TO block on the same line as address/contact info (e.g., \"A : ... Date : 12/07/2023\"), exclude the \"Date...\" portion from BILLED_TO and use that \"Date\" as INVOICE_DATE (unless it's clearly a due/delivery/service date).\n",

      "  3) If none of the above, you may use the account holder name from bank details (\"Account Name\") as the COMPANY if it appears to be the sender and there is no better labeled sender; prefer a brand/company name over a person’s name when both are present.\n",
      "- If a \"PAY TO\"/\"Payable to\" block lists both a person and a company (e.g., \"Olivia Wilson\" and \"Wardi LLC\"), choose the company name.\n",

      "- If multiple totals are present:\n",
      "  - Prefer totals that appear in the financial summary area together with \"Subtotal/Tax/Discount\" (typically after the itemized section).\n",
      "  - If a large detached banner shows a conflicting \"TOTAL DUE\" while the summary area shows \"Subtotal/Tax/Total\", prefer the summary area total.\n",
      "  - Prefer the amount on the same line as the final total label; if not, take the nearest following amount line.\n",
      "- Handle OCR concatenations such as \"$ 8987TOTAL\" by capturing the currency value (\"$8987\") and ignoring the trailing \"TOTAL\".\n",
      "- Normalize minor currency spacing as described; preserve other punctuation and grouping.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) BANK_NAME\n",
      "- Value following labels: \"Bank Name\" or \"Bank\" (case-insensitive).\n",
      "- Also accept an unlabeled bank name line immediately adjacent to bank/account details (e.g., a standalone line like \"Borcele Bank\" directly above/below account name/number).\n",
      "- Handles stacked layouts where the next line begins with \":\" followed by the value (e.g., \"Bank\" then \": Fauget Bank\").\n",
      "- If the immediate next line is itself a label (ends with \":\" or is a known label like \"Name\", \"Account\"), skip it and look for the correct value.\n",
      "- If multiple candidates exist near the bank details, prefer the value that looks like a bank (contains words like \"Bank\", \"Banco\", \"Banc\", \"Credit\", \"Trust\"). If only a person-like name appears under \"Bank Name\" and no bank-like line is available, capture it as-is.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) ACCOUNT_NAME\n",
      "- Value following labels: \"Account Name\", \"A/C Name\" (case-insensitive).\n",
      "- Do NOT use \"Name\" alone as a substitute for \"Account Name\". If only \"Name\" appears without \"Account\", leave ACCOUNT_NAME as \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "8) ACCOUNT_NUMBER\n",
      "- Value following labels: \"Account Number\", \"Account No\", \"Account No.\", \"Acct No\", \"A/C No\", \"A/C Number\" (case-insensitive). Preserve dashes and spaces exactly (e.g., \"0012-3456-7890\", \"0123 4567 8901\").\n",
      "- Do NOT accept \"Account\" alone or \"Bank Account\" as valid labels unless it clearly functions as the account-number label in the bank details section and no preferred label is present nearby; if you accept \"Bank Account\", treat it as ACCOUNT_NUMBER.\n",
      "- Do NOT use \"Bank Account\" for BANK_NAME.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional disambiguation and stopping rules\n",
      "- Keep BILLED_TO and COMPANY distinct based on their labeled sections even if they share the same address/email.\n",
      "- For multi-line blocks (BILLED_TO or sender/PAY TO), stop at the next clear header/section label or a blank line to avoid bleeding into unrelated text (e.g., \"Description\", \"Terms\", \"Bank Details\").\n",
      "- Avoid misreading unrelated \"No.\", \"No Items\", or \"No:\" near tables/totals as an invoice number unless explicitly tied to invoice context (see INVOICE_NUMBER rule).\n",
      "- Avoid including banner words like \"INVOICE\" adjacent to captured values when OCR wraps text (e.g., strip \"INVOICE\" if it’s glued to a value).\n",
      "- When labels are fused or adjacent without spacing (e.g., \"EMAIL :  ...WEBSITE: ...\"), treat them as separate and avoid using these contact lines as COMPANY unless explicitly labeled as sender.\n",

      "- Also accept a standalone number prefixed with \"#\" ONLY if it is clearly adjacent to the main “INVOICE” header area (same line or within the next 1–2 lines under a standalone INVOICE banner) and not obviously tied to another label (e.g., not after \"Account ID\").\n",
      "- Do NOT accept ambiguous labels such as “No:”, “No.”, “No”, or “NO.” by themselves unless “Invoice” appears on the same line (e.g., “Invoice No:”).\n",
      "- If the captured value starts with a single leading “#”, strip that one leading “#” (keep the rest).\n",
      "- Preserve internal punctuation/hyphens (e.g., “INV-00008”, “2000-15”, “001”).\n",
      "\n",
      "2) INVOICE_DATE\n",
      "- Preferred labels, in this order: \"Invoice Date\", \"Date of Issue\", \"Issue Date\", \"Date Issued\", then \"Date\".\n",
      "- If both a general \"Date\" and a more specific variant appear, use the more specific one tied to the invoice.\n",
      "- Exclude dates inside the BILLED_TO block (see BILLED_TO boundaries).\n",
      "- If the value line contains extra concatenated text, keep only the date portion.\n",
      "- If no date label is present, you may use a single standalone date near the main invoice header/totals only if it is clearly associated with the invoice and not within recipient/sender blocks; otherwise leave empty.\n",
      "- Do NOT derive the date from lines like “NO. 001 02.05.2024” unless a valid date label is present on that same line (e.g., “Invoice Date: 02.05.2024”). A bare “NO.” line is not a valid date label.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) BILLED_TO\n",
      "- The customer/recipient, not the sender.\n",
      "- Find blocks labeled: \"Bill To\", \"Billed To\", \"Invoice To\", \"To:\", \"Customer\", \"Client\".\n",
      "- Capture subsequent lines starting after the label until a clear break:\n",
      "  - a blank line, or\n",
      "  - the start of another labeled section/header (e.g., \"Description\", \"Subtotal\", \"Tax\", \"Discount\", \"TOTAL\"/\"TOTAL DUE\"/\"AMOUNT DUE\"/\"Grand Total\", \"BANK\"/\"Bank Details\", \"TERMS\", \"PAY TO\", \"Payable to\", \"From\", \"Company\", \"DATE\" as a standalone label).\n",
      "- If a “Date” appears on the same line as BILLED_TO info, exclude the “Date …” part from BILLED_TO; consider it for INVOICE_DATE if it follows a valid date label.\n",
      "- Join captured lines with \", \", trimming extra spaces/commas. Keep in-block contact labels like “Phone:” or “Email:” if they appear.\n",
      "- Fallback only if the labeled block is otherwise empty: if a single unambiguous recipient name appears within the next few lines before another major section and is not clearly the sender, use it; else leave \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "4) COMPANY\n",
      "- The issuer/seller (party sending the invoice).\n",
      "- Preferred sources (in priority):\n",
      "  1) Explicit sender blocks: \"From\", \"Company\", \"Seller\", \"Vendor\", \"Supplier\", \"Issuer\", \"Freelancer\", \"PAY TO\", \"Pay to\", \"Payable to\".\n",
      "  2) A clear brand/company name near the main INVOICE header/top banner (e.g., containing “Inc”, “LLC”, “Ltd”, “Company”, “Co.”, “Agency”, “Studio”, “GmbH”, “Pvt”, “Limited”).\n",
      "- If a sender block lists both a person and a company:\n",
      "  - Prefer the distinct company/brand name (e.g., “Timmerman Industries”) over the person’s name, unless the context clearly indicates the person is the sole issuer and no distinct company name is presented as the brand.\n",
      "- Do NOT use generic/template titles as the company (e.g., “Freelance Invoice Template”, “White Modern Sales Invoice”, “INVOICE/TAX RECEIPT”, “YOUR LOGO”).\n",
      "- If no explicit issuer/company can be identified using the above, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "5) TOTAL_AMOUNT\n",
      "- The final amount payable.\n",
      "- Accept only amounts tied to one of these labels (case-insensitive): \"TOTAL\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT DUE\", \"AMOUNT DUE\", \"BALANCE DUE\", \"Grand Total\", \"TOTAL DUE\".\n",
      "- Selection rules when multiple candidates exist:\n",
      "  - Prefer totals that appear in the financial summary area after the itemized section (often near “Subtotal/Tax/Discount”).\n",
      "  - Prefer the amount on the same line as the final total label; if not present, take the nearest following amount line.\n",
      "  - If both an early “Total Amount” (near items) and a later “TOTAL/Grand Total/Amount Due” exist, choose the later one in the summary section.\n",
      "  - Prefer the last (bottom-most) valid final total label if multiple are present.\n",
      "- Exclude subtotals, taxes, discounts, per-line totals, and detached banner totals.\n",
      "- Normalize minor currency spacing (e.g., \"$ 3,045.60\" → \"$3,045.60\"). Preserve punctuation exactly.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) BANK_NAME\n",
      "- Value following labels: \"Bank Name\" or \"Bank\".\n",
      "- Supports stacked layouts where the next line begins with \":\" followed by the value (e.g., a line “Bank” then next line “: Fauget Bank” → \"Fauget Bank\").\n",
      "- If the immediate next line is itself a label (ends with \":\" or is a known label like \"Name\", \"Account\"), skip it and continue to the next plausible value line within the bank details area.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) ACCOUNT_NAME\n",
      "- Value following labels: \"Account Name\", \"A/C Name\".\n",
      "- Do NOT accept \"Name\" alone or \"Pay to\"/\"Payable to\" as substitutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "8) ACCOUNT_NUMBER\n",
      "- Value following labels: \"Account Number\", \"Account No\", \"Account No.\", \"Acct No\", \"A/C No\", \"A/C Number\".\n",
      "- Preserve dashes and spaces in the number exactly.\n",
      "- Do NOT accept \"Account\" alone, \"Bank Account\", or ambiguous abbreviations like \"Acc:\" without “No”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional disambiguation and stopping rules:\n",
      "- Keep BILLED_TO and COMPANY distinct based on their own labeled sections, even if they share address/email lines.\n",
      "- For multi-line blocks (BILLED_TO or sender/PAY TO), stop at the next clear header/section label or a blank line to avoid bleeding into unrelated text (e.g., “Description”, “Terms”, “Bank Details”, “DATE”).\n",
      "- Avoid misreading nearby “No.”, “NO.”, “No Items”, or “NO.” in tables as an invoice number unless explicitly tied to “Invoice”.\n",
      "- Avoid including banner words like “INVOICE” adjacent to captured values.\n",
      "- Banner-adjacent “#12345” may be used for INVOICE_NUMBER only if it is clearly under or on the INVOICE header.\n",
      "- When matching a date, do not harvest dates inferred from unlabeled “NO. 001 02.05.2024”-style lines; these are ambiguous unless accompanied by a valid date label.\n",
      "\n",
      "Implementation tips:\n",
      "- Preprocess: trim lines; keep order.\n",
      "- Create helper functions to (a) detect labels, (b) classify decorative headers, (c) detect date-like strings (e.g., dd/mm/yyyy, dd.mm.yyyy, yyyy-mm-dd, “5 December 2030”).\n",
      "- When seeking a value after a label, skip over decorative “INVOICE” banners and unrelated labels; for dates, allow up to 3 non-empty lines lookahead to find a date.\n",
      "- Join multi-line blocks with \", \" and trim extra commas/spaces.\n",

      "- If a “Date …” appears on the same line as BILLED_TO info, exclude the “Date …” part from BILLED_TO; consider it for INVOICE_DATE only if tied to a valid date label (not “Date” inside BILLED_TO).\n",
      "- Join captured lines with \", \", trimming extra spaces/commas. Keep in-block contact labels like “Phone:”, “Email:”.\n",
      "- Fallback only if the labeled block is otherwise empty: if a single unambiguous recipient name appears within the next few lines before another major section and is not clearly the sender, use it; else leave \"\".\n",

      "4) COMPANY\n",
      "- The issuer/seller (party sending the invoice).\n",
      "- Preferred sources (in priority):\n",
      "  1) Explicit sender blocks: \"From\", \"Company\", \"Seller\", \"Vendor\", \"Supplier\", \"Issuer\", \"Freelancer\", \"PAY TO\", \"Pay to\", \"Payable to\".\n",
      "  2) A clear brand/company name near the main INVOICE header/top banner (e.g., containing “Inc”, “LLC”, “Ltd”, “Company/Co.”, “Agency”, “Studio”, “GmbH”, “Pvt”, “Limited”, or a distinct brand phrase). Prefer the brand that appears visually associated with the INVOICE header/logo area or tagline (e.g., “Your Business Partner”) over generic/template titles.\n",
      "- If a sender block lists both a person and a company:\n",
      "  - Prefer the distinct company/brand name (e.g., “Timmerman Industries”) over the person’s name, unless the context clearly indicates the person is the sole issuer and no distinct company name is presented as the brand.\n",
      "- Do NOT use generic/template titles as the company (e.g., “Freelance Invoice Template”, “HVAC Invoice Template”, “Trucking Invoice Template”, “White Modern Sales Invoice”, “INVOICE/TAX RECEIPT”, “YOUR LOGO”).\n",
      "- If multiple brand-like names appear near the top, prefer:\n",
      "  - a name that recurs in sender contact/bank account name, OR\n",
      "  - the one adjacent to the INVOICE banner/logo/tagline, OR\n",
      "  - the more distinct/complete brand over a generic industry phrase.\n",
      "- If no explicit issuer/company can be identified using the above, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "5) TOTAL_AMOUNT\n",
      "- The final amount payable.\n",
      "- Accept only amounts tied to one of these labels (case-insensitive): \"TOTAL\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT DUE\", \"AMOUNT DUE\", \"BALANCE DUE\", \"Grand Total\", \"TOTAL DUE\".\n",
      "- Selection rules when multiple candidates exist:\n",
      "  - Prefer totals that appear in the financial summary area after the itemized section (often near “Subtotal/Tax/Discount”).\n",
      "  - Prefer the amount on the same line as the final total label; if not present, take the nearest following amount line (skip blank lines and decorative separators).\n",
      "  - If both an early “Total/Total Amount” near items and a later “TOTAL/Grand Total/Amount Due/TOTAL DUE” exist, choose the later one in the summary section.\n",
      "  - Prefer the last (bottom-most) valid final total label if multiple are present.\n",
      "- Exclude subtotals, taxes, discounts, per-line totals, and detached banner totals.\n",
      "- Normalize minor currency spacing only after the currency symbol as specified.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) BANK_NAME\n",
      "- Value following labels: \"Bank Name\" or \"Bank\".\n",
      "- Supports stacked layouts where the next line begins with \":\" followed by the value (e.g., a line “Bank” then next line “: Fauget Bank” → \"Fauget Bank\").\n",
      "- If the immediate next line is itself a label (ends with \":\" or is a known label like \"Name\", \"Account\"), skip it and continue to the next plausible value line within the bank details area.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) ACCOUNT_NAME\n",
      "- Value following labels: \"Account Name\", \"A/C Name\".\n",
      "- Do NOT accept \"Name\" alone or \"Pay to\"/\"Payable to\" as substitutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "8) ACCOUNT_NUMBER\n",
      "- Value following labels: \"Account Number\", \"Account No\", \"Account No.\", \"Acct No\", \"A/C No\", \"A/C Number\".\n",
      "- Preserve dashes and spaces in the number exactly.\n",
      "- Do NOT accept \"Account\" alone, \"Bank Account\", or ambiguous abbreviations like \"Acc:\" without “No”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional disambiguation and stopping rules:\n",
      "- Keep BILLED_TO and COMPANY distinct based on their own labeled sections, even if they share address/email lines.\n",
      "- For multi-line blocks (BILLED_TO or sender/PAY TO), stop at the next clear header/section label or a hard blank-line break per the continuation heuristic to avoid bleeding into unrelated text (e.g., “Description”, “Terms”, “Bank Details”, “DATE”).\n",
      "- Avoid misreading nearby “No.”, “NO.”, “No Items”, or “NO.” in tables as an invoice number unless explicitly tied to “Invoice” or clearly adjacent to the INVOICE header per the acceptance rule above.\n",
      "- Avoid including banner words like “INVOICE” adjacent to captured values.\n",
      "- Banner-adjacent “#12345” or “No: 12345” may be used for INVOICE_NUMBER only if clearly under/on the INVOICE header area and not any other field.\n",
      "\n",
      "Implementation tips:\n",
      "- Preprocess: trim each line and keep order; collapse runs of whitespace in label detection only (do not alter captured values beyond the currency-space normalization).\n",
      "- Create helper functions to:\n",
      "  - detect labels (case-insensitive, allowing optional trailing colon and minor spacing),\n",
      "  - classify decorative headers (e.g., “INVOICE”, “Invoice Template”, industry template titles),\n",
      "  - detect date-like strings,\n",
      "  - decide if a line is a section header vs. content,\n",
      "  - apply the address/contact continuation heuristic across blank lines.\n",
      "- When seeking a value after a label, skip over decorative “INVOICE” banners and unrelated labels; for dates, allow up to 3 non-empty lines lookahead to find a date.\n",
      "- When joining multi-line blocks, join with \", \" and trim stray commas/spaces.\n",
      "- Output exactly one JSON object as specified, with all eight keys present.\n",

      "   - If multiple candidates exist, prefer one explicitly labeled with \"Invoice ...\" over a generic \"No\". If still ambiguous, choose the one closest to the main invoice header and not within other sections like bank details or items.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) INVOICE_DATE\n",
      "   - Preferred labels (highest to lowest): \"Invoice Date\", \"Date of Issue\", \"Date Issued\", \"Issue Date\", \"Issued on\", \"Date\".\n",
      "   - If using the generic \"Date\", ensure it is not part of or inside the BILLED_TO/customer block; prefer a date located in the header/summary area associated with invoice metadata.\n",
      "   - Exclude non-issuing dates such as \"Service Date\", \"Due Date\", \"Payment Due\", \"Pay by\", \"Delivery Date\".\n",
      "   - When the label and value are on separate lines, capture the next non-empty line after the label.\n",
      "   - Keep the format exactly as written (e.g., \"15/08/2028\", \"01 April 2022\", \"11.02.2030\", \"12.06.2024\").\n",
      "\n",
      "3) BILLED_TO\n",
      "   - This is the customer/recipient (not the sender).\n",
      "   - Labels to match (case-insensitive): \"Bill To\", \"Billed To\", \"Invoice To\", \"Invoice to\", \"To:\", \"Customer\", \"Client\", \"INVOICE TO\", \"Issued to\", \"Issued To\".\n",
      "   - Capture that block’s lines until a clear section break: a blank line, or the start of another major section/label. Treat the following as breaks (case-insensitive): \"Description\", \"Item\", \"UNIT PRICE\", \"PRICE\", \"QTY\", \"TOTAL\" when used as a table header, \"TOTAL\", \"TOTAL DUE\", \"GRAND TOTAL\", \"SUBTOTAL\", \"SUB-TOTAL\", \"TAX\", \"TAX RATE\", \"DISCOUNT\", \"BANK\", \"Bank\", \"Bank Details\", \"TERMS\", \"NOTES\", \"PAY TO\", \"From\", \"Freelancer\", \"Company\", \"Invoice #\", \"Invoice No\", \"INVOICE NO\", \"Date\", \"Invoice Date\", \"Date Issued\", \"Date of Issue\", \"Due Date\", \"Payment Method\", \"PAYMENT METHOD\", \"Authorized Signature\", \"Authorized Signed\", \"Pay by\".\n",

      "   - Return a single string combining the block’s lines joined with \", \". Trim extra spaces/commas. Keep internal labels like \"Phone:\"/\"Email:\" if they are inside the billed-to block.

      "   - Within a \"PAY TO\"/\"From\" block that mixes entity, address, and bank details, choose the issuer entity line (e.g., the company/person name), not the bank name, and stop before any \"Bank\"/\"Bank Name\" section.\n",
      "   - Do NOT infer the company from decorative/template headers or themes (e.g., \"Green IT Company Professional Service Invoice\", \"Freelance Invoice Template\") unless the name appears within a labeled \"From\"/\"PAY TO\"/Company-like block as defined above.\n",

      "   - Exclude \"SUBTOTAL\"/\"SUB-TOTAL\", \"TAX\", \"Tax Rate\", \"Discount\", per-line item totals, and table headers (e.g., ignore \"DESCRIPTION QTY TOTAL\").\n",
      "   - Selection rules when multiple candidates exist:\n",
      "     - The amount should appear on the same line as the grand-total label; if not, take the nearest following non-empty amount line that is part of the summary area (not separated by unrelated headers like \"UNIT PRICE\", \"DESCRIPTION\", \"PRICE\", \"QTY\").\n",
      "     - Prefer totals that appear in the end-of-invoice summary area directly adjacent to/after any subtotal/tax/discount lines (the itemized summary).\n",
      "     - If multiple grand-total-style labels exist (e.g., both \"TOTAL\" and \"TOTAL DUE\"), choose the one positioned with or immediately following the subtotal/tax/discount block rather than a standalone or decorative header elsewhere.\n",
      "     - Do not pick a number purely because it is largest. Ignore per-line amounts.\n",
      "   - Normalize spacing between any currency symbol and digits if needed (e.g., \"$ 550\" -> \"$550\").\n",
      "\n",
      "6) BANK_NAME\n",
      "   - Only capture a value that follows labels (case-insensitive): \"Bank Name\" or \"Bank\" when used as a label.\n",
      "   - Accept \"Bank Name: XYZ\" or a lone \"Bank\" line followed by the bank name on the next non-empty line.\n",
      "   - Do not backfill a bank name from lines above the label. If \"Bank:\" appears but the following non-empty line is another label (e.g., \"Account No:\"), set BANK_NAME to \"\".\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "7) ACCOUNT_NAME\n",
      "   - Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Account Name\", \"Account name\", \"A/C Name\".\n",
      "   - Only capture when the label precedes the value (same line or next non-empty line). If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "8) ACCOUNT_NUMBER\n",
      "   - Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Account Number\", \"Account No\", \"Account No.\", \"Acct No\", \"Acct No.\", \"Account #\", \"Acct #\", \"A/C No\", \"A/C No.\", \"A/C Number\", \"A/C #\".\n",
      "   - Preserve dashes and spaces as they appear (e.g., \"0012-3456-7890\", \"0123 4567 8901\").\n",
      "   - Do NOT use \"Bank Account\" or plain \"Account\" as a substitute label unless it explicitly includes \"No\", \"Number\", or \"#\".\n",
      "   - Only capture when the label precedes the value (same line or next non-empty line). If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional guidance and disambiguation:\n",
      "- When capturing multi-line blocks (BILLED_TO or PAY TO/FROM), stop at the next clear header/section label or a blank line to avoid bleeding into unrelated sections (e.g., \"Description\", \"Terms\", \"Bank Details\", \"Payment Method\", \"Authorized Signed\", \"Thank you\", any \"Date\"/\"Due Date\"/\"Invoice No.\").\n",
      "- If both billed-to and from/company blocks share the same address/email, still keep them distinct: BILLED_TO is the customer/recipient; COMPANY is the issuer/seller.\n",
      "- Prefer explicit labels over inference; if no acceptable label is found for a field, output \"\" rather than guessing from generic headers.\n",
      "- Do not treat brand words near \"INVOICE\" (e.g., \"INVOICEBorcelle\", \"Green IT Company Professional Service Invoice\") as COMPANY unless they appear within a labeled \"From\"/\"PAY TO\"/company block.\n",
      "- Tie-breakers:\n",
      "  - For INVOICE_NUMBER, if both a generic \"No:\" value and an explicit \"Invoice No.\" value exist, use the explicit \"Invoice No.\" value.\n",
      "  - For TOTAL_AMOUNT, if both \"TOTAL\" adjacent to the item summary and a separate large \"TOTAL DUE\" amount appear elsewhere, choose the amount that is with the itemized summary (subtotal/tax/discount context).\n",
      "- Be strict about label-to-value direction: labels must come before their values. Do not extract values that precede their labels (e.g., a number line that appears above \"Account No:\" should not be captured for ACCOUNT_NUMBER).\n",

      "- The customer/recipient, not the sender.\n",
      "- Find blocks labeled by: \"Bill To\", \"Billed To\", \"Invoice To\", \"Invoice to:\", \"To:\", \"Customer\", \"Client\".\n",
      "- Capture subsequent lines starting after the label until a clear break:\n",
      "  - a blank line, or\n",

      "4) COMPANY\n",
      "- The issuer/seller (party sending the invoice).\n",
      "- Preferred sources (priority order):\n",

      "  2) A clear brand/company name near the main INVOICE header/top banner:\n",
      "     - Accept names containing indicators like “Inc”, “LLC”, “Ltd”, “Company”, “Co.”, “Agency”, “Studio”, “GmbH”, “Pvt”, “Limited”.\n",
      "     - If the banner line concatenates “INVOICE” with a brand (e.g., “INVOICEBorcelle”), extract the part after “INVOICE” (“Borcelle”) as the brand.\n",
      "     - Avoid generic/template descriptors (e.g., “Green IT Company Professional Service Invoice”, “Freelance Invoice Template”, “INVOICE/TAX RECEIPT”, “YOUR LOGO”) unless the same name appears as a sender block elsewhere.\n",
      "- Do NOT use the recipient as COMPANY.\n",
      "- If no explicit issuer/company can be identified using the above, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "5) TOTAL_AMOUNT\n",
      "- Accept only amounts tied to one of these labels (case-insensitive): \"TOTAL\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT DUE\", \"AMOUNT DUE\", \"BALANCE DUE\", \"Grand Total\", \"TOTAL DUE\".\n",
      "- Selection rules when multiple candidates exist:\n",
      "  - Identify the financial summary area: a contiguous block that contains at least two of [\"Subtotal\", \"Tax\"/\"Tax Rate\", \"Discount\", any final total label above]. Prefer totals inside this block.\n",
      "  - Within the summary block, choose the final total label by preference: \"Grand Total\" > \"TOTAL DUE\" > \"TOTAL AMOUNT DUE\" > \"AMOUNT DUE\" > \"BALANCE DUE\" > \"TOTAL\" > \"TOTAL AMOUNT\".\n",
      "  - Prefer the last (bottom-most) valid final total label within the summary block.\n",
      "  - Prefer the amount on the same line as the final total label; if absent, look ahead up to the next 2 non-empty lines within the same block for the first standalone currency/amount line. Do not cross into other sections (e.g., “Bank”, “Terms”, “PAY TO”).\n",
      "  - If there is no clear amount tied to the bottom-most final total label within the summary block, fall back to the latest earlier final total label that directly carries an amount on the same line (e.g., “Total $285”).\n",
      "- Exclude:\n",
      "  - Subtotals, taxes, discounts, per-line totals, column headers (“Total” in table headings), and detached/banner totals (e.g., amounts near “PAY TO:” or decorative sidebars).\n",
      "- Normalize only minor currency spacing (e.g., \"$ 3,045.60\" → \"$3,045.60\").\n",
      "\n",
      "6) BANK_NAME\n",
      "- Value following labels: \"Bank Name\" or \"Bank\".\n",
      "- Supports stacked layouts where the next line begins with \":\" followed by the value (e.g., line: “Bank”, next line: “: Fauget Bank” → capture \"Fauget Bank\").\n",
      "- Also accept a standalone bank name line that clearly contains the word “Bank” and appears in a bank details section (near account fields).\n",
      "- If the immediate next line is itself a label (ends with \":\" or is a known label like \"Name\", \"Account\"), skip and continue to the next plausible value line within the bank details area.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) ACCOUNT_NAME\n",
      "- Value following labels: \"Account Name\", \"A/C Name\".\n",
      "- Do NOT accept \"Name\" alone or \"Pay to\"/\"Payable to\" as substitutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "8) ACCOUNT_NUMBER\n",
      "- Value following labels: \"Account Number\", \"Account No\", \"Account No.\", \"Acct No\", \"A/C No\", \"A/C Number\".\n",
      "- Preserve dashes and spaces exactly.\n",
      "- Do NOT accept \"Account\" alone, \"Bank Account\", or ambiguous abbreviations like \"Acc:\" without “No”.\n",
      "- Do not confuse with phone numbers or invoice numbers; ensure it appears in the bank details/payment context.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional disambiguation and stopping rules:\n",
      "- Keep BILLED_TO and COMPANY distinct based on their own labeled sections, even if they share address/email lines.\n",
      "- For multi-line blocks (BILLED_TO or sender/PAY TO), stop at the next clear header/section label or a blank line to avoid bleeding into unrelated text (e.g., “Description”, “Terms”, “Bank Details”, “DATE”, “Authorized Signed”, “Thank you for your business!”, “PAYMENT METHOD”).\n",
      "- Avoid misreading nearby “No.”, “NO.”, “No Items”, or “NO.” in tables as an invoice number unless explicitly tied to “Invoice”.\n",
      "- Avoid including banner words like “INVOICE” adjacent to captured values.\n",
      "- “#12345” may be used for INVOICE_NUMBER only if clearly under or on the INVOICE header banner.\n",
      "- When a date label and a “Date-like” line are separated by other labels, you may skip intervening label lines within a 3-line lookahead, but prefer the first true date string encountered.\n",
      "- Exclude due dates and payment deadlines (e.g., “Pay by: 23 June 2023”) from INVOICE_DATE.\n",
      "\n",
      "Implementation tips:\n",
      "- Preprocess: trim lines and collapse obvious decorative empty lines, but preserve order.\n",
      "- Create helpers to:\n",
      "  - detect label lines (ends with \":\" or equals a known label) vs. value lines,\n",
      "  - detect decorative banners (standalone “INVOICE”, template names, taglines),\n",
      "  - detect date-like strings (e.g., dd/mm/yyyy, dd.mm.yyyy, yyyy-mm-dd, “5 December 2030”, “01 / 02 / 2023”),\n",
      "  - detect amount-like strings (currency symbol + number, or number with currency).\n",
      "- After extraction, sanity-check:\n",
      "  - INVOICE_DATE should look date-like; if not, set \"\".\n",
      "  - TOTAL_AMOUNT should look like a currency/amount; if not found under valid labels, set \"\".\n",
      "  - Ensure a single leading \"#\" is stripped from INVOICE_NUMBER if present.\n",
      "\n",

      "   - Also accept a standalone number prefixed with \"#\" that appears near the main INVOICE header (e.g., \"#91028829\").\n",
      "   - Capture the value on the same line or the next non-empty line.\n",

      "   - Exclude non-issuing dates: \"Service Date\", \"Due Date\", \"Payment Due\", \"Pay by\", \"Delivery Date\".\n",
      "   - If a date is unlabeled but appears in the header area immediately around the invoice number (within ~3 lines of \"INVOICE\" or the invoice number) and there is no conflicting labeled date, capture it as INVOICE_DATE.\n",
      "   - When label and value are on separate lines, capture the next non-empty line.\n",
      "   - Keep the format exactly as written (e.g., \"15/08/2028\", \"01 / 02 / 2023\", \"12.06.2024\").\n",
      "\n",
      "3) BILLED_TO (the customer/recipient, not the sender)\n",
      "   - Labels to match (case-insensitive): \"Bill To\", \"Billed To\", \"Invoice To\", \"Invoice to\", \"INVOICE TO\", \"To:\", \"Customer\", \"Client\".\n",
      "   - Capture that block’s lines until a clear section break: a blank line, or the start of another major section/label.

      "\n",
      "6) BANK_NAME\n",
      "   - Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Bank Name\", or \"Bank\" when used as a label (\"Bank:\", \"Bank -\", a line \"Bank\" followed by the bank name on the next line).\n",
      "   - Do not use \"Bank Code\" as the bank name.\n",

      "   - Preserve dashes and spaces exactly as they appear (e.g., \"0012-3456-7890\", \"0123 4567 8901\").\n",
      "   - Do NOT use labels like \"Bank Account\" or plain \"Account\" unless they explicitly include \"No\", \"Number\", or \"#\".\n",

      "   - Also accept a standalone number prefixed with \"#\" near the main INVOICE header.\n",
      "   - Capture the value on the same line or the next non-empty line.\n",
      "   - Strip a leading \"#\" from the captured value; preserve other punctuation/hyphens (e.g., \"INV-00008\", \"2000-15\", \"001\").\n",
      "   - If multiple candidates exist, prefer one explicitly labeled with \"Invoice ...\" over a generic \"No\". If still ambiguous, choose the one closest to the main invoice header.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) INVOICE_DATE\n",
      "   - Preferred labels (highest to lowest): \"Invoice Date\", \"Date of Issue\", \"Issue Date\", \"Date Issued\", \"Date\".\n",
      "   - If using the generic \"Date\", ensure it is not inside the BILLED_TO/customer block; prefer a date located in the header/summary area associated with invoice metadata.\n",
      "   - Exclude non-issuing dates such as \"Service Date\", \"Due Date\", \"Payment Due\", \"Pay by\", \"Delivery Date\".\n",
      "   - When the label and value are on separate lines (e.g., \"DATE OF ISSUE\" followed by a date on the next line), capture the next non-empty line.\n",
      "   - Keep the format exactly as written (e.g., \"15/08/2028\", \"01 / 02 / 2023\", \"12.06.2024\").\n",
      "\n",
      "3) BILLED_TO\n",
      "   - This is the customer/recipient (not the sender).\n",
      "   - Labels to match (case-insensitive, including fused forms): \"Bill To\", \"Billed To\", \"Invoice To\", \"INVOICE TO\", \"To:\", \"Customer\", \"Client\".\n",
      "   - Capture that block’s lines until a clear section break: a blank line, or the start of another major section/label. Treat the following as breaks (case-insensitive): \"Description\", \"Item\", \"TOTAL\", \"TOTAL DUE\", \"SUBTOTAL\", \"SUB-TOTAL\", \"TAX\", \"TAX RATE\", \"DISCOUNT\", \"BANK\", \"Bank\", \"Bank Details\", \"TERMS\", \"NOTES\", \"PAY TO\", \"From\", \"Freelancer\", \"Company\", \"Invoice #\", \"Invoice No\", \"INVOICE NO\", \"Date\", \"Due Date\", \"Payment Method\", \"PAYMENT METHOD\", \"Authorized Signature\", \"Authorized Signed\", \"Pay by\".\n",
      "   - Important: stop the BILLED_TO block at any \"Date\"/\"Invoice Date\"/\"Date of Issue\" line; do not include date lines inside BILLED_TO.\n",
      "   - Return a single string combining the block’s lines joined with \", \". Trim extra spaces/commas. Keep internal labels like \"Phone:\"/\"Email:\" if they are inside the billed-to block.\n",
      "   - If a billed-to label is present but there are no following non-empty value lines before a break, leave BILLED_TO as \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "4) COMPANY\n",
      "   - The issuing/seller (the party sending the invoice).\n",
      "   - Preferred sources/labels (case-insensitive): \"From\", \"Company\", \"Seller\", \"Vendor\", \"Supplier\", \"Issuer\", \"PAY TO\", \"Pay To\", \"Freelancer\", \"Service Provider\".\n",
      "   - If a \"PAY TO\" block exists, extract the entity from there; if both a person and a company are listed (e.g., a personal name and a company like \"Wardi LLC\"), choose the company (\"Wardi LLC\"); otherwise use the person’s name.\n",
      "   - If no explicit seller/company block can be identified via the labels above, use a conservative fallback:\n",
      "     - Take the prominent name at the top of the document near the main \"INVOICE\" header and/or adjacent to the issuer’s contact details (address/phone/email/website). This is usually the sender’s brand/company.\n",
      "     - Exclude obvious template/theme/tagline text (e.g., lines containing only words like \"Invoice\", \"Professional Service Invoice\", \"Template\").\n",
      "     - Prefer the first plausible organization/name line; avoid pulling unrelated taglines.\n",
      "   - Do NOT infer the company from concatenated brand words embedded into the word \"INVOICE\" (e.g., \"INVOICEBorcelle\") unless it appears within a labeled seller block.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) TOTAL_AMOUNT\n",
      "   - The final amount payable (grand/final total).\n",
      "   - Prefer explicit grand-total labels (case-insensitive): \"TOTAL\", \"TOTAL:\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT DUE\", \"AMOUNT DUE\", \"BALANCE DUE\", \"Grand Total\", \"TOTAL DUE\".\n",
      "   - Exclude \"SUBTOTAL\"/\"SUB-TOTAL\", \"TAX\", \"Tax Rate\", \"Discount\", per-line item totals, and intermediate totals.\n",
      "   - Selection rules when multiple candidates exist:\n",
      "     - The amount should appear on the same line as the grand-total label; if not, take the nearest following non-empty amount line.\n",
      "     - Prefer totals that appear in the end-of-invoice summary area directly adjacent to/after any subtotal/tax/discount lines (the itemized summary).\n",
      "     - If both a header/hero \"Total\" near the top and a total near the itemized summary exist, choose the one positioned with or immediately following the subtotal/tax/discount block.\n",
      "     - Handle jammed formatting: accept patterns like \"$ 8987TOTAL\", \"TOTAL$ 8987\", \"TOTAL$8987\" by extracting the currency amount and normalizing spacing (e.g., \"$8987\").\n",
      "     - If the itemized summary has \"Subtotal\", \"Tax\", \"Discount\" and then the next non-empty line is a standalone currency amount without a label, treat that amount as the grand total.\n",
      "     - If a \"TOTAL\" label has no adjacent amount and is immediately followed by unrelated headers/sections, fall back to the closest explicit grand-total-style label in the summary area. Do not pick a number purely because it is largest.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) BANK_NAME\n",
      "   - Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Bank Name\", or \"Bank\" when used as a label.\n",
      "   - Accept \"Bank Name: XYZ\" or a lone \"Bank\" line followed by the bank name on the next non-empty line.\n",
      "   - If the immediate next line after \"Bank\"/\"Bank Name\" looks like another label (e.g., ends with \":\" or contains \"Bank\" + \":\"), skip it and capture the next non-empty non-label-like line.\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "7) ACCOUNT_NAME\n",
      "   - Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Account Name\", \"Acct. Name\", \"Acct Name\", \"A/C Name\", \"Beneficiary Name\", \"Account Holder\", \"Account Holder Name\".\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "8) ACCOUNT_NUMBER\n",
      "   - Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Account Number\", \"Account No\", \"Account No.\", \"Acct No\", \"Acct No.\", \"Acct. No\", \"Acct. No.\", \"Account #\", \"Acct #\", \"A/C No\", \"A/C No.\", \"A/C Number\", \"A/C #\".\n",
      "   - Also accept \"Bank Account\" or \"Bank A/C\" as the account-number label only when they directly precede a number-like value (digits/spaces/dashes) and there is no competing explicit \"Account Number\"/\"Account No\"/\"A/C No\" label elsewhere.\n",
      "   - Preserve dashes and spaces as they appear (e.g., \"0012-3456-7890\", \"0123 4567 8901\").\n",
      "   - Do NOT use a plain \"Account\" or \"Bank Account\" line as a substitute unless it clearly includes \"No\", \"Number\", \"#\", or it is the only available account-number style label as noted above.\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional guidance and disambiguation:\n",
      "- When capturing multi-line blocks (BILLED_TO or PAY TO/FROM), stop at the next clear header/section label or a blank line to avoid bleeding into unrelated sections (e.g., \"Description\", \"Terms\", \"Bank Details\", \"Payment Method\", \"Authorized Signed\", \"Thank you\", \"Date\").\n",
      "- If both billed-to and from/company blocks share the same address/email, still keep them distinct: BILLED_TO is the customer/recipient; COMPANY is the issuer/seller.\n",
      "- Prefer explicit labels over inference; if no acceptable label is found for a field, output \"\" rather than guessing from generic text.\n",
      "- Tie-breakers:\n",
      "  - For INVOICE_NUMBER, if both a generic \"No:\" value and an explicit \"Invoice No.\" value exist, use the explicit \"Invoice ...\" value.\n",
      "  - For TOTAL_AMOUNT, if both a header \"TOTAL\" and a \"TOTAL\"/\"AMOUNT DUE\" adjacent to the itemized summary exist, choose the one with the itemized summary.\n",
      "- Robustness tips:\n",
      "  - Be tolerant of irregular spacing and fused words in labels (e.g., \"INVOICE TOCOMPANY:\", \"Thynk Unl imited Bank\").\n",
      "  - When a value line is clearly a label (ends with \":\" and contains 1–3 words), do not capture it as the value; move to the next non-empty line.\n",

      "\n",
      "3) BILLED_TO\n",
      "   - This is the customer/recipient (not the sender).\n",

      "   - Also handle paired headings like \"FROM: TO:\". In such cases, capture the block that belongs to \"TO:\" (the recipient).\n",
      "   - Capture that block’s lines until a clear section break: a blank line, or the start of another major section/label.

      "     - When both an early \"Total Amount\" and a later \"TOTAL/TOTAL DUE\" exist, choose the one positioned with (or immediately after) the Subtotal/Tax/Discount block near the end of the invoice. Avoid totals that appear isolated within or above the item list.\n",
      "     - If a \"TOTAL\" label has no adjacent amount and is immediately followed by unrelated headers/sections, fall back to the closest explicit grand-total-style label in the summary area (e.g., \"TOTAL AMOUNT\", \"AMOUNT DUE\") that does have an adjacent amount. Do not pick a number purely because it is largest.\n",
      "   - Normalize spacing between any currency symbol and digits if needed (e.g., \"$ 550\" -> \"$550\").\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Additional guidance and tie-breakers:\n",
      "- When capturing multi-line blocks (BILLED_TO or PAY TO/FROM), stop at the next clear header/section label or a blank line to avoid bleeding into unrelated sections (e.g., \"Description\", \"Terms\", \"Bank Details\", \"Payment Method\", \"Authorized Signed\", \"Thank you\", \"Date\").\n",
      "- If both billed-to and from/company blocks share the same address/email, still keep them distinct: BILLED_TO is the customer/recipient; COMPANY is the issuer/seller.\n",
      "- Prefer explicit labels over inference; if no acceptable label is found for a field, output \"\" rather than guessing from a generic header.\n",
      "- Avoid using standalone brand words near \"INVOICE\" (e.g., \"INVOICEBorcelle\") as COMPANY unless they appear within a labeled \"From\"/\"PAY TO\"/company block.\n",
      "- INVOICE_NUMBER tie-breakers:\n",
      "  - If both a generic \"No:\" value and an explicit \"Invoice No.\" value exist, use the explicit \"Invoice No.\" value.\n",
      "  - Never take a \"No.\" from an items table header.\n",
      "- TOTAL_AMOUNT tie-breakers:\n",
      "  - If both \"TOTAL\" adjacent to the item summary and a separate large \"TOTAL DUE\" amount appear elsewhere, choose the one that is with the itemized summary (subtotal/tax/discount context).\n",

      "- Ensure the output is parseable JSON: starts with { and ends with }, no trailing commas, no comments.\n",

      "Value handling:\n",
      "- Preserve values exactly as they appear in the source (keep currency symbols, commas, periods, hyphens, internal spaces), except:\n",
      "  - Normalize minor spacing in currency values by removing a space between the currency symbol and digits (e.g., \"$ 346.50\" -> \"$346.50\").\n",

      "\n",
      "Field-specific rules and label variants:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) INVOICE_NUMBER\n",

      "   - Preferred labels (highest to lowest): \"Invoice Date\", \"Date of Issue\", \"Issue Date\", \"Date Issued\", \"Date\".\n",
      "   - If using the generic \"Date\", ensure it is not part of and not located inside the BILLED_TO/customer block; prefer a date located in the header/summary area associated with invoice metadata.\n",
      "   - Exclude non-issuing dates such as \"Service Date\", \"Due Date\", \"Payment Due\", \"Pay by\", \"Delivery Date\".\n",
      "   - When the label and value are on separate lines (e.g., \"DATE OF ISSUE\" followed by a date on the next line), capture the next non-empty line.\n",

      "  INVOICE_NUMBER, INVOICE_DATE, BILLED_TO, COMPANY, TOTAL_AMOUNT, BANK_NAME, ACCOUNT_NAME, ACCOUNT_NUMBER\n",
      "- Use double quotes for all JSON keys and all string values. Do not use single quotes.\n",
      "- No code fences, no rationale, no extra text before/after the JSON.\n",
      "- Always include all eight keys. If a field cannot be found, set its value to \"\" (empty string).\n",
      "- Trim leading/trailing whitespace from all values.\n",
      "- Preserve values exactly as they appear (including currency symbols, commas, periods, hyphens, and internal spaces), except:\n",
      "  - Normalize spacing between any currency symbol and digits (e.g., \"$ 346.50\" -> \"$346.50\").\n",
      "  - For INVOICE_NUMBER, strip a single leading \"#\" if present (keep internal hyphens/punctuation).\n",
      "  - Do not reformat dates.\n",
      "\n",
      "General parsing approach:\n",
      "- Split the input into lines and process top-to-bottom. Use case-insensitive label matching, but capture values in their original casing.\n",
      "- A label and its value may appear:\n",
      "  - on the same line (e.g., \"Bank Name: ABC Bank\"), or\n",
      "  - on consecutive lines where the value is the next non-empty line after the label (e.g., \"INVOICE DATE\" then \"07/01/2023\").\n",
      "- Prefer explicitly labeled fields. If no acceptable label exists, leave the field empty rather than guessing from decorative text.\n",
      "- Ignore decorative/template text not tied to a labeled field (e.g., big headers like \"INVOICE\", \"Professional Service Invoice\", theme names, taglines, number strings like \"1 2 3 4\", URLs, or social handles).\n",
      "\n",
      "Field-specific rules and robust label variants:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) INVOICE_NUMBER\n",
      "- Accept labels (case-insensitive): \"Invoice Number\", \"Invoice No\", \"Invoice No.\", \"Invoice NO.\", \"Invoice #\", \"INVOICE NO.\", \"INVOICE NO\", \"INV#\", \"Invoice ID\", \"Invoice#\", \"INV No\", \"INV No.\", and generic \"No\", \"No.\", \"No:\" when clearly used as the invoice identifier near the main invoice header.\n",
      "- Also accept a standalone number prefixed with \"#\" that appears near an INVOICE header (e.g., \"#01234\"); strip the leading \"#\".\n",
      "- Capture value on the same line or next non-empty line after the label.\n",
      "- If multiple candidates exist, prefer the one explicitly labeled with \"Invoice ...\" over generic \"No\", and prefer the one closest to the main invoice header.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) INVOICE_DATE\n",
      "- Preferred labels (highest to lowest): \"Invoice Date\", \"Date of Issue\", \"Issue Date\", \"Date Issued\", \"Date\".\n",
      "- If using generic \"Date\", ensure it’s not a due/payment/service/delivery date and is not within the BILLED_TO block.\n",
      "- Exclude non-issuing dates such as \"Service Date\", \"Due Date\", \"Payment Due\", \"Pay by\", \"Delivery Date\".\n",
      "- If label and value are split across lines, capture the next non-empty line.\n",
      "- Keep the date exactly as written (e.g., \"5 December 2030\", \"02/05/2021\", \"01 / 02 / 2023\", \"12.06.2024\").\n",
      "\n",
      "3) BILLED_TO\n",
      "- This is the customer/recipient (not the sender).\n",
      "- Labels to match (case-insensitive): \"Bill To\", \"Billed To\", \"Invoice To\", \"Invoice to\", \"To:\", \"Customer\", \"Client\", \"INVOICE TO\".\n",
      "- Capture the block’s lines starting from the label’s value line (same line after colon or the next non-empty line) and continue until a clear section break: a blank line, or the start of another major section/label. Treat these as breaks (case-insensitive):\n",
      "  \"Description\", \"Item\", \"TOTAL\", \"TOTAL DUE\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT DUE\", \"AMOUNT DUE\",\n",
      "  \"SUBTOTAL\", \"SUB-TOTAL\", \"SUB TOTAL\", \"TAX\", \"TAX RATE\", \"DISCOUNT\", \"Bank\", \"Bank Name\",\n",

      "  \"Authorized Signature\", \"Authorized Signed\", \"Pay by\".\n",
      "- Important: stop the BILLED_TO block at any \"Date\"/\"Invoice Date\"/\"Date of Issue\" line; do not include date lines inside BILLED_TO.\n",
      "- Backward capture allowance: if the label line (\"Invoice to\", \"Bill To\", etc.) appears immediately after what looks like a single-line recipient name/address and before the next section, capture the immediately preceding contiguous non-empty line(s) (typically 1–3 lines) as the BILLED_TO block.\n",
      "- Return a single string with the block’s lines joined by \", \". Keep internal labels like \"Phone:\"/\"Email:\" if they appear inside the billed-to block.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) COMPANY\n",
      "- The issuing/seller (the party sending the invoice).\n",
      "- Preferred sources/labels (case-insensitive): \"From\", \"Company\", \"Seller\", \"Vendor\", \"Supplier\", \"Issuer\", \"PAY TO\", \"Pay To\", \"Freelancer\", \"Service Provider\".\n",
      "- If a \"PAY TO\" block lists both a person and a company, choose the company name.\n",
      "- Do NOT infer the company from decorative/template headers or themes (e.g., \"Green IT Company Professional Service Invoice\").\n",
      "- If no explicit seller/company block via the labels above is identified, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "5) TOTAL_AMOUNT\n",
      "- The final amount payable (grand/final total).\n",
      "- Prefer explicit grand-total labels (case-insensitive): \"TOTAL\", \"TOTAL:\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT DUE\", \"AMOUNT DUE\", \"BALANCE DUE\", \"Grand Total\", \"TOTAL DUE\".\n",
      "- Exclude \"SUBTOTAL\"/\"SUB-TOTAL\", \"TAX\", \"Tax Rate\", \"Discount\", and per-line item totals.\n",
      "- Selection rules:\n",
      "  - The amount should appear on the same line as the grand-total label; if not, take the nearest following non-empty amount line.\n",
      "  - Prefer totals in the end-of-invoice summary area directly adjacent to/after the subtotal/tax/discount lines (the itemized summary).\n",
      "  - If multiple grand-total-style labels exist, choose the one positioned with or immediately following the subtotal/tax/discount block rather than a standalone header elsewhere.\n",
      "  - If a \"TOTAL\" label has no adjacent amount and is followed by unrelated sections, fall back to the closest explicit grand-total-style label in the summary area.\n",
      "- Normalize spacing between currency symbol and digits (e.g., \"$ 550\" -> \"$550\"). Do not compute totals.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) BANK_NAME\n",
      "- Accept labels (case-insensitive): \"Bank Name\", or \"Bank\" when used as a label.\n",
      "- Also accept \"Bank Details\"/\"BANK DETAILS\"/\"Bank Details:\" as a section header: in that case, capture the next non-empty line within that section as BANK_NAME unless it is clearly an account field (starts with \"Account\", \"A/C\", \"Acct\").\n",
      "- A label and its value may be on the same line or on consecutive lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) ACCOUNT_NAME\n",
      "- Accept labels (case-insensitive): \"Account Name\", \"Account name\", \"A/C Name\".\n",
      "- Capture the value on the same line or next non-empty line.\n",
      "\n",
      "8) ACCOUNT_NUMBER\n",
      "- Accept labels (case-insensitive): \"Account Number\", \"Account No\", \"Account No.\", \"Acct No\", \"Acct No.\", \"Account #\", \"Acct #\", \"A/C No\", \"A/C No.\", \"A/C Number\", \"A/C #\".\n",
      "- Preserve dashes and spaces as they appear (e.g., \"0012-3456-7890\", \"0123 4567 8901\").\n",
      "- Do NOT use \"Bank Account\" or plain \"Account\" as a substitute unless it explicitly includes \"No\", \"Number\", or \"#\".\n",
      "- Capture the value on the same line or next non-empty line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional guidance:\n",
      "- When capturing multi-line blocks (BILLED_TO or PAY TO/FROM), stop at the next clear header/section label or a blank line to avoid bleeding into unrelated sections (e.g., \"Description\", \"Terms\", \"Bank Details\", \"Payment Method\", \"Authorized Signed\", \"Thank you\", \"Date\").\n",
      "- Even if billed-to and company blocks share addresses/emails, keep them distinct.\n",
      "- Prefer explicit labels over inference; when in doubt, return an empty string.\n",
      "- Ignore unrelated numeric strings, decorative separators, URLs, and taglines that are not part of labeled fields.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Heuristics to detect decorative or structural lines:\n",
      "- Decorative headers: standalone “INVOICE”, “TAX INVOICE”, or template titles like “Freelance Invoice Template”, “White Modern Sales Invoice”.\n",
      "- Table header row context: A line containing or adjacent (within 1–2 lines) to two or more of [\"Description\", \"Quantity\"/\"Qty\", \"Unit Price\", \"Amount\", \"Total Amount\"] is a table header area. Treat labels in this area as column headers, not summary labels.\n",
      "- Financial summary area: Usually appears after the items table; look for presence of \"Subtotal\", \"Tax\", \"Discount\", and final total labels. Prefer totals in this area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Field-specific rules:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) INVOICE_NUMBER\n",
      "- Accept only if labeled with one of the invoice number labels above.\n",
      "- Also accept a standalone number prefixed with \"#\" ONLY if it is clearly adjacent to the main “INVOICE” header area:\n",
      "  - Same line as the “INVOICE” banner, or within the next 1–2 non-empty lines directly beneath a standalone INVOICE banner.\n",
      "  - It must not be tied to another label (e.g., not after \"Account ID\").\n",
      "- Do NOT accept ambiguous labels such as “No:”, “No.”, “No”, or “NO.” alone unless “Invoice” appears on the same line (e.g., “Invoice No:”).\n",
      "- If the captured value starts with a single leading “#”, strip that one leading “#” (keep the rest).\n",
      "- Preserve internal punctuation/hyphens (e.g., “INV-00008”, “2000-15”, “001”).\n",
      "\n",
      "2) INVOICE_DATE\n",
      "- Preferred labels, in this order: \"Invoice Date\", \"Date of Issue\", \"Issue Date\", \"Date Issued\", then \"Date\".\n",
      "- Use the most specific label when multiple variants exist; prefer one explicitly tied to the invoice over a generic \"Date\".\n",
      "- Exclude dates inside the BILLED_TO block (see BILLED_TO boundaries).\n",
      "- When a label and value are on separate lines:\n",
      "  - Scan forward for a date-like string up to the next 3 non-empty lines by default, skipping over intervening label lines and decorative headers.\n",
      "  - If the only intervening lines are decorative headers (e.g., “INVOICE”), invoice-number lines (e.g., “#12345”, “Invoice No: …”), or other label lines, you may extend the lookahead to up to 5 non-empty lines to accommodate stacked header layouts.\n",
      "- If the value line contains extra concatenated text, keep only the date portion (e.g., “23 March 2025INVOICE” → “23 March 2025”).\n",
      "- If no valid date label is present, you may use a single standalone date near the main invoice header or in the financial summary area only if it is clearly associated with the invoice and not within recipient/sender blocks; otherwise leave \"\".\n",
      "- Do NOT derive the date from lines like “NO. 001 02.05.2024” unless a valid date label is present on that same line (e.g., “Invoice Date: 02.05.2024”).\n",
      "- Do not use \"Service Date\", \"Due Date\", \"Delivery Date\", or similar as the invoice date.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) BILLED_TO\n",
      "- The customer/recipient, not the sender.\n",
      "- Find blocks labeled: \"Bill To\", \"Billed To\", \"Invoice To\", \"To:\", \"Customer\", \"Client\".\n",
      "- Capture subsequent lines starting after the label until a clear break:\n",
      "  - a blank line, or\n",
      "  - the start of another labeled section/header (e.g., \"Description\", \"Subtotal\", \"Tax\", \"Discount\", any final total label, \"Bank\"/\"Bank Details\", \"Terms\", \"PAY TO\"/\"Payable to\", \"From\", \"Company\", \"DATE\" as a standalone label).\n",
      "- If a “Date” appears on the same line as BILLED_TO info, exclude the “Date …” part from BILLED_TO; consider it for INVOICE_DATE only if it follows a valid date label.\n",
      "- Join captured lines with \", \", trimming extra spaces/commas. Keep in-block contact labels like “Phone:” or “Email:” if they appear.\n",
      "- Fallback only if the labeled block is otherwise empty: if a single unambiguous recipient name appears within the next few lines before another major section and is not clearly the sender, use it; else leave \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "4) COMPANY\n",
      "- The issuer/seller (party sending the invoice).\n",
      "- Preferred sources (in priority):\n",
      "  1) Explicit sender blocks: \"From\", \"Company\", \"Seller\", \"Vendor\", \"Supplier\", \"Issuer\", \"Freelancer\", \"PAY TO\", \"Pay to\", \"Payable to\".\n",
      "  2) A clear brand/company name near the main INVOICE header/top banner (e.g., containing “Inc”, “LLC”, “Ltd”, “Company”, “Co.”, “Agency”, “Studio”, “GmbH”, “Pvt”, “Limited”).\n",
      "- If a sender block lists both a person and a company:\n",
      "  - Prefer the distinct company/brand name (e.g., “Timmerman Industries”) over the person’s name, unless the context clearly indicates the person is the sole issuer and no distinct company name is presented as the brand.\n",
      "- Do NOT use generic/template titles as the company (e.g., “Freelance Invoice Template”, “White Modern Sales Invoice”, “INVOICE/TAX RECEIPT”, “YOUR LOGO”).\n",
      "- If no explicit issuer/company can be identified using the above, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "5) TOTAL_AMOUNT\n",
      "- The final amount payable.\n",
      "- Accept only amounts tied to one of these final total labels (case-insensitive): \"TOTAL\", \"TOTAL:\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT DUE\", \"AMOUNT DUE\", \"BALANCE DUE\", \"Grand Total\", \"TOTAL DUE\".\n",
      "Selection and disambiguation rules:\n",
      "  - Strongly prefer totals that appear in the financial summary area after the itemized section (often near “Subtotal/Tax/Discount”).\n",
      "  - Prefer the last (bottom-most) valid final total label if multiple are present.\n",
      "  - Prefer the amount on the same line as the final total label; if not present, take the nearest following amount line that is not part of a table row (i.e., not aligned with or immediately under \"Unit Price\"/\"Amount\" columns and not adjacent to item descriptions).\n",
      "  - If a \"TOTAL\"/\"TOTAL AMOUNT\" label appears in or immediately adjacent to a table header row (near \"Quantity\"/\"Unit Price\"/\"Amount\"/\"Description\"), treat it as a column header and do NOT use the immediate following currency values; continue searching for a final total label in the summary area.\n",
      "  - If both an early “Total Amount” near items and a later “TOTAL/Grand Total/Amount Due” exist, choose the later one in the summary section.\n",
      "  - Exclude subtotals, taxes, discounts, per-line totals, and detached banner totals.\n",
      "- Normalize minor currency spacing after the symbol (e.g., \"$ 3,045.60\" → \"$3,045.60\"). Preserve punctuation and grouping exactly.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) BANK_NAME\n",
      "- Value following labels: \"Bank Name\" or \"Bank\".\n",
      "- Supports stacked layouts where the next line begins with \":\" followed by the value (e.g., a line “Bank” then next line “: Fauget Bank” → \"Fauget Bank\").\n",
      "- If the immediate next line is itself a label (ends with \":\" or is a known label like \"Name\", \"Account\"), skip it and continue to the next plausible value line within the bank details area.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) ACCOUNT_NAME\n",
      "- Value following labels: \"Account Name\", \"A/C Name\".\n",
      "- Do NOT accept \"Name\" alone or \"Pay to\"/\"Payable to\" as substitutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "8) ACCOUNT_NUMBER\n",
      "- Value following labels: \"Account Number\", \"Account No\", \"Account No.\", \"Acct No\", \"A/C No\", \"A/C Number\".\n",
      "- Preserve dashes and spaces in the number exactly.\n",
      "- Do NOT accept \"Account\" alone, \"Bank Account\", or ambiguous abbreviations like \"Acc:\" without “No”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional boundaries and stopping rules:\n",
      "- Keep BILLED_TO and COMPANY distinct based on their own labeled sections, even if they share address/email lines.\n",
      "- For multi-line blocks (BILLED_TO or sender/PAY TO), stop at the next clear header/section label or a blank line to avoid bleeding into unrelated text (e.g., “Description”, “Terms”, “Bank Details”, “DATE”).\n",
      "- Avoid misreading nearby “No.”, “NO.”, “No Items”, or “NO.” in tables as an invoice number unless explicitly tied to “Invoice”.\n",
      "- Avoid including banner words like “INVOICE” adjacent to captured values.\n",
      "- Banner-adjacent “#12345” may be used for INVOICE_NUMBER only if it is clearly under or on the INVOICE header as described above.\n",
      "- When matching a date, do not harvest dates inferred from unlabeled “NO. 001 02.05.2024”-style lines; these are ambiguous unless accompanied by a valid date label.\n",
      "\n",
      "Implementation tips and step order:\n",
      "1) Preprocess: Split into lines, trim each line (preserve original text for output), and keep their order.\n",
      "2) Build helpers:\n",
      "   - is_label(line), is_decorative_header(line) [e.g., “INVOICE”], is_table_header_context(idx) [checks nearby lines for table header tokens],\n",
      "   - is_final_total_label(line), is_date_like(token), is_money(token).\n",
      "3) Extract INVOICE_NUMBER:\n",
      "   - First check labeled forms; then check banner-adjacent “#…”.\n",
      "4) Extract INVOICE_DATE using the preferred label order and lookahead (3 lines, extend to 5 only if intervening lines are decorative/labels/invoice number). Trim trailing concatenated text beyond the date.\n",
      "5) Extract BILLED_TO block from its labeled section; join with “, ”; stop at blank/next section label.\n",
      "6) Extract COMPANY from sender/PAY TO/Freelancer/Company-labeled blocks; prefer distinct company brand over a person if both appear.\n",
      "7) Extract TOTAL_AMOUNT:\n",
      "   - Collect all candidate final total labels; discard those in table header context; pick the bottom-most candidate in the summary area. Capture amount on the same line or nearest following non-table amount line.\n",
      "8) Extract BANK_NAME, ACCOUNT_NAME, ACCOUNT_NUMBER from their labels; support stacked “:” on next line.\n",
      "9) Build and output the single JSON object with exactly the eight required keys and double-quoted string values.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember:\n",
      "- Be strict about labels, boundaries, and formatting.\n",

      "   - Also accept a standalone number prefixed with \"#\" near the main INVOICE header.\n",
      "   - Capture the value on the same line or the next non-empty line.\n",
      "   - Strip a leading \"#\" from the captured value; preserve other punctuation/hyphens (e.g., \"INV-00008\", \"2000-15\", \"001\").\n",
      "   - If multiple candidates exist, prefer one explicitly labeled with \"Invoice ...\" over a generic \"No\". If still ambiguous, choose the one closest to the main INVOICE header and not part of any other section (e.g., not inside bank or terms).\n",
      "\n",
      "2) INVOICE_DATE\n",
      "   - Preferred labels (highest to lowest): \"Invoice Date\", \"Date of Issue\", \"Issue Date\", \"Date Issued\", then generic \"Date\".\n",
      "   - If using the generic \"Date\", ensure it is not a due date and not inside the BILLED_TO/customer block; prefer a date located in the header/summary area associated with invoice metadata.\n",
      "   - Exclude non-issuing dates such as \"Service Date\", \"Due Date\", \"Payment Due\", \"Pay by\", \"Delivery Date\".\n",
      "   - When the label and value are on separate lines (e.g., \"DATE OF ISSUE\" followed by a date on the next line), capture the next non-empty line.\n",

      "\n",
      "3) BILLED_TO\n",
      "   - This is the customer/recipient (not the sender).\n",
      "   - Labels to match (case-insensitive): \"Bill To\", \"Billed To\", \"Invoice To\", \"INVOICE TO\", \"To:\", \"Customer\", \"Client\", and also \"Issued To\"/\"ISSUED TO\".\n",

      "   - Do NOT infer the company from decorative/template headers or themes (e.g., \"Green IT Company Professional Service Invoice\", \"HVAC INVOICE\", \"Freelance Invoice Template\", theme names).\n",
      "   - If multiple candidate name lines appear in the \"From\"/\"PAY TO\" area, prefer the first non-empty line that looks like an entity name. If both normal-case and ALL-CAPS duplicates appear, choose the first occurrence after the label.\n",
      "   - If no explicit seller/company label can be identified, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "5) TOTAL_AMOUNT\n",

      "   - Selection rules when multiple candidates exist:\n",
      "     - Prefer totals in the end-of-invoice summary area directly adjacent to/after any subtotal/tax/discount lines (the itemized summary).\n",
      "     - The amount should appear on the same line as the grand-total label; if not, take the nearest following non-empty amount line. It may be separated by 1–3 lines; skip lines that are just percentages (e.g., \"10%\") or unrelated headers.\n",
      "     - If both \"TOTAL\" and \"TOTAL DUE\"/\"AMOUNT DUE\" appear, choose the one positioned with or immediately following the subtotal/tax/discount block rather than a standalone or decorative header elsewhere.\n",
      "     - If a \"TOTAL\" label has no adjacent amount and is immediately followed by unrelated headers/sections, fall back to the closest explicit grand-total-style label in the summary area.\n",
      "   - Normalize spacing between any currency symbol and digits if needed (e.g., \"$ 550\" -> \"$550\").\n",
      "\n",
      "6) BANK_NAME\n",
      "   - Primary labels (case-insensitive): \"Bank Name\", \"Bank name\", or \"Bank\" when used as a label.\n",
      "   - Accept \"Bank Name: XYZ\" or a lone \"Bank\" line followed by the bank name on the next line.\n",
      "   - Additionally, within a clearly marked banking/payment section (e.g., \"BANK DETAILS\", \"Bank Details\", \"PAYMENT METHOD\", \"PAYMENT INFORMATION\"), if a standalone line contains the word \"Bank\" (e.g., \"Borcele Bank\") and there is no more explicit \"Bank Name\" label nearby, capture that line as BANK_NAME.\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "7) ACCOUNT_NAME\n",
      "   - Labels (case-insensitive): \"Account Name\", \"Account name\", \"A/C Name\", \"Beneficiary Name\", \"Account Holder Name\".\n",
      "   - Capture the value on the same line or the next non-empty line.\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "8) ACCOUNT_NUMBER\n",
      "   - Labels (case-insensitive): \"Account Number\", \"Account No\", \"Account No.\", \"Acct No\", \"Acct No.\", \"Account #\", \"Acct #\", \"A/C No\", \"A/C No.\", \"A/C Number\", \"A/C #\".\n",
      "   - Preserve dashes and spaces as they appear (e.g., \"0012-3456-7890\", \"0123 4567 8901\").\n",
      "   - Do NOT use \"Bank Account\" or plain \"Account\" as a substitute label unless it explicitly includes \"No\", \"Number\", or \"#\".\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional guidance and disambiguation:\n",
      "- When capturing multi-line blocks (BILLED_TO or PAY TO/FROM), stop at the next clear header/section label or a blank line to avoid bleeding into unrelated sections (e.g., \"Description\", \"Terms\", \"Bank Details\", \"Payment Method\", \"Authorized Signed\", \"Thank you\", \"Date\").\n",
      "- If both billed-to and from/company blocks share the same address/email, still keep them distinct: BILLED_TO is the customer/recipient; COMPANY is the issuer/seller.\n",
      "- Prefer explicit labels over inference. If no acceptable label is found for a field, output \"\" rather than guessing from a generic header.\n",
      "- Avoid using standalone brand words near \"INVOICE\" (e.g., \"INVOICEBorcelle\") as COMPANY unless they appear within a labeled \"From\"/\"PAY TO\"/company block.\n",
      "- Tie-breakers:\n",
      "  - For INVOICE_NUMBER, if both a generic \"No:\" value and an explicit \"Invoice No.\" value exist, use the explicit \"Invoice No.\" value.\n",
      "  - For TOTAL_AMOUNT, if both \"TOTAL\" adjacent to the item summary and a separate large \"TOTAL DUE\" amount appear elsewhere, choose the amount that is with the itemized summary (subtotal/tax/discount context).\n",

      "- Preserve internal punctuation/hyphens (e.g., “INV-00008”, “2000-15”, “001”).\n",
      "\n",
      "2) INVOICE_DATE\n",
      "- Preferred labels, in this order: \"Invoice Date\", \"Date of Issue\", \"Issue Date\", \"Date Issued\", then \"Date\".\n",
      "- If both a general \"Date\" and a more specific variant appear, use the more specific one tied to the invoice.\n",
      "- Exclude dates inside the BILLED_TO block (see BILLED_TO boundaries).\n",
      "- If the value line contains extra concatenated text, keep only the date portion (e.g., “23 March 2025INVOICE” → “23 March 2025”).\n",
      "- If no date label is present, you may use a single standalone date near the main invoice header/totals only if it is clearly associated with the invoice and not within recipient/sender blocks; otherwise leave \"\".\n",
      "- Do NOT derive the date from unlabeled “NO. 001 02.05.2024”-style lines unless that same line also contains a valid date label (e.g., “Invoice Date: 02.05.2024”).\n",
      "\n",
      "3) BILLED_TO\n",
      "- The recipient/customer, not the sender.\n",
      "- Find a labeled block: \"Bill To\", \"Billed To\", \"Invoice To\", \"To:\", \"Customer\", or \"Client\".\n",
      "- Capture subsequent lines starting after the label until a clear break:\n",
      "  - a blank line, or\n",

      "- If “Date …” appears on the same line as BILLED_TO info, exclude the “Date …” portion from BILLED_TO; consider it for INVOICE_DATE only if preceded by a valid date label.\n",
      "- Join captured lines with \", \" in their original order, trimming extra commas/spaces. Keep in-block contact labels like “Phone: …” or “Email: …” if they appear within the block.\n",
      "- Fallback only if the labeled block is otherwise empty: if a single unambiguous recipient name appears within the next few lines before another major section and is not clearly the sender, use it; else \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "4) COMPANY\n",
      "- The issuer/seller (party sending the invoice).\n",
      "- Preferred sources (in priority):\n",
      "  1) Explicit sender blocks: \"From\", \"Company\", \"Seller\", \"Vendor\", \"Supplier\", \"Issuer\", \"Freelancer\", \"PAY TO\"/\"Pay to\"/\"Payable to\".\n",
      "  2) A clear brand/company name near the main INVOICE header/top banner (containing common company terms like “Inc”, “LLC”, “Ltd”, “Company”, “Co.”, “Agency”, “Studio”, “GmbH”, “Pvt”, “Limited”).\n",
      "- If a sender block lists both a person and a company, prefer the distinct company/brand (e.g., “Timmerman Industries”) over a person’s name unless no distinct company is presented.\n",
      "- Do NOT use generic/template titles as the company (e.g., “Freelance Invoice Template”, “White Gold Simple Business Invoice”, “Cleaning Invoice Template”, “INVOICE/TAX RECEIPT”, “YOUR LOGO”).\n",
      "- If no explicit issuer/company can be identified using the above, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "5) TOTAL_AMOUNT\n",
      "- Accept only amounts tied to one of these labels (case-insensitive): \"TOTAL\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT DUE\", \"AMOUNT DUE\", \"BALANCE DUE\", \"Grand Total\", \"TOTAL DUE\".\n",
      "- Selection rules when multiple candidates exist:\n",
      "  - Build candidates by scanning the entire document for these labels.\n",
      "  - For each label occurrence, prefer an amount on the same line; if none, take the nearest following amount that appears before another clear label/section break. Skip amounts that are clearly part of item rows (e.g., a run of per-line amounts without a summary label context).\n",
      "  - Prefer totals in the financial summary area after the itemized section (often near or after “Subtotal/Tax/Discount”).\n",
      "  - If both an early “Total Amount” (near items) and a later “TOTAL/Grand Total/Amount Due” exist, choose the later one in the summary section.\n",
      "  - Choose the last (bottom-most) valid final total label across the document when multiple are present.\n",
      "- Exclude subtotals, taxes, discounts, per-line totals, and detached banner totals.\n",
      "- Normalize minor currency spacing as specified; otherwise preserve the amount exactly.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) BANK_NAME\n",
      "- Value following labels: \"Bank Name\" or \"Bank\".\n",
      "- Supports stacked layouts where the next line begins with \":\" followed by the value (e.g., a line “Bank” then next line “: Fauget Bank” → \"Fauget Bank\").\n",
      "- If the immediate next line is itself a label (ends with \":\" or is a known label like \"Name\", \"Account\"), skip it and continue to the next plausible value line within the bank details area.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) ACCOUNT_NAME\n",
      "- Value following labels: \"Account Name\", \"A/C Name\".\n",
      "- Do NOT accept \"Name\" alone or \"Pay to\"/\"Payable to\" as substitutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "8) ACCOUNT_NUMBER\n",
      "- Value following labels: \"Account Number\", \"Account No\", \"Account No.\", \"Acct No\", \"A/C No\", \"A/C Number\".\n",
      "- Preserve dashes and spaces exactly.\n",
      "- Do NOT accept \"Account\" alone, \"Bank Account\", or ambiguous abbreviations like \"Acc:\" without “No”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional disambiguation and stopping rules:\n",
      "- Keep BILLED_TO and COMPANY distinct based on their own labeled sections, even if they share address/email lines.\n",
      "- For multi-line blocks (BILLED_TO or sender/PAY TO), stop at the next clear header/section label or a blank line to avoid bleeding into unrelated text (e.g., “Description”, “Terms”, “Bank Details”, standalone “DATE”).\n",
      "- Avoid misreading nearby “No.”, “NO.”, “No Items”, or table column headers as an invoice number unless explicitly tied to “Invoice”.\n",
      "- Treat “INVOICE”, “PROFORMA INVOICE”, “TAX INVOICE” banners as decorative headers, not values; however, they define the main header area for adjacency checks (e.g., banner-adjacent “#12345” for INVOICE_NUMBER).\n",
      "- When matching dates, ignore “Service Date”, “Due Date”, “Delivery Date” unless they also explicitly match the approved date labels for INVOICE_DATE.\n",
      "\n",
      "Implementation checklist before output:\n",
      "- Make exactly one pass to collect candidates per field using the above rules and priorities.\n",
      "- Choose the best candidate per field; if none, set \"\".\n",
      "- Join multi-line BILLED_TO with \", \" and trim extra commas/spaces.\n",
      "- Apply currency spacing normalization only as specified.\n",
      "- Output exactly one valid JSON object with double-quoted keys and values, no extra text.\n",

      "- Exclude subtotals, taxes, discounts, per-line totals, and detached banner totals.\n",
      "- Normalize only the space right after a currency symbol (e.g., \"$ 3,045.60\" → \"$3,045.60\"). Preserve everything else exactly.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) BANK_NAME\n",
      "- Value following labels: \"Bank Name\" or \"Bank\".\n",
      "- Supports stacked layouts:\n",
      "  - Forward-stacked: label line then next non-label value line (skipping lines that are labels or just “:”).\n",
      "  - Reverse-stacked: if the label line is encountered and no suitable value is on the same or next lines, take the immediately preceding non-empty non-label line as the value (prefer a bank-like string).\n",
      "- If the immediate next line is itself a label (ends with \":\" or is a known label like \"Name\", \"Account\"), skip it and continue to the next plausible value line within the bank details area.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) ACCOUNT_NAME\n",
      "- Value following labels: \"Account Name\", \"A/C Name\".\n",
      "- Also support reverse-stacked capture where the value is the immediately preceding non-empty non-label line.\n",
      "- Do NOT accept \"Name\" alone or \"Pay to\"/\"Payable to\" as substitutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "8) ACCOUNT_NUMBER\n",
      "- Value following labels: \"Account Number\", \"Account No\", \"Account No.\", \"Acct No\", \"A/C No\", \"A/C Number\".\n",
      "- Also support reverse-stacked capture where the value is the immediately preceding non-empty non-label line.\n",
      "- Preserve dashes and spaces in the number exactly.\n",
      "- Do NOT accept \"Account\" alone, \"Bank Account\", or ambiguous abbreviations like \"Acc:\" without “No”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional disambiguation and stopping rules:\n",
      "- Keep BILLED_TO and COMPANY distinct based on their own labeled sections, even if they share address/email lines.\n",
      "- For multi-line blocks (BILLED_TO or sender/PAY TO), stop at the next clear header/section label or a blank line to avoid bleeding into unrelated text (e.g., “Description”, “Terms”, “Bank Details”, standalone “DATE”, totals labels).\n",
      "- Avoid misreading nearby “No.”, “NO.”, “No Items”, or “NO.” in tables as an invoice number unless explicitly tied to “Invoice”.\n",
      "- Avoid including banner words like “INVOICE” adjacent to captured values.\n",
      "- Banner-adjacent “#12345” may be used for INVOICE_NUMBER only if it is clearly under or on the INVOICE header.\n",
      "- When matching a date, do not harvest dates inferred from unlabeled “NO. 001 02.05.2024”-style lines; these are ambiguous unless accompanied by a valid date label.\n",
      "\n",
      "Implementation tips:\n",
      "- Preprocess: trim lines; preserve order.\n",
      "- Create helpers to: (a) detect labels, (b) classify decorative headers, (c) detect date-like strings (dd/mm/yyyy, dd.mm.yyyy, mm/dd/yyyy, yyyy-mm-dd, “5 December 2030”, etc.), (d) detect currency amounts.\n",
      "- When seeking a value after a label, skip over decorative “INVOICE” banners and unrelated labels; for dates, allow up to 3 non-empty lines lookahead to find a date.\n",
      "- For the final JSON: ensure keys are exactly as specified, values are all strings (possibly \"\"), and the JSON is syntactically valid with double quotes and no trailing commas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Domain-specific nuances from observed templates:\n",
      "- Many templates place a prominent brand/company name in the title (e.g., “Green IT Company Professional Service Invoice”); prefer this as COMPANY over a generic PAY TO block with banking lines.\n",
      "- Final totals often appear in a vertical stack: a \"TOTAL\" label followed by a % line (tax) and then the currency amount; accept the amount line as TOTAL_AMOUNT when it is the nearest following amount in the summary area.\n",
      "- Bank sections frequently use reverse-stacked labels where the value is printed above the label (e.g., value line \"Avery Davis\" followed by \"Account Name\", number line \"0123 4567 8901\" followed by \"Account No\", bank name line \"Borcelle Bank\" followed by \"Bank\"). Handle these patterns bidirectionally as described.\n",

      "GENERAL PARSING STRATEGY:\n",
      "- Treat the input as a sequence of lines.\n",
      "- Use case‑insensitive label matching; capture values in their original casing.\n",
      "- A label and its value may be:\n",
      "  - on the same line (e.g., \"Bank Name: ABC Bank\"), or\n",
      "  - on consecutive lines (label on one line, value on the next non‑empty line).\n",
      "- Also handle “stacked/column” layouts:\n",
      "  - If multiple labels appear in sequence (e.g., \"Invoice#\", \"Date\"), followed by multiple bare values (e.g., \"52131\", \"01 / 02 / 2023\"), assign values in order: first value to first label, second value to second label, etc.\n",
      "  - If a label is split across adjacent short lines (e.g., \"Bank\" on one line and \"Name\" on the next), treat the combined text as the label (\"Bank Name\").\n",
      "  - If a value line begins with a leading \":\" or \"-\", trim that leading punctuation before capturing the value.\n",
      "- When a single line contains multiple labeled segments (e.g., \"A : 123 Anywhere St., Any City, Date : 12/07/2023\"), split and capture each labeled segment independently.\n",
      "- Ignore decorative/template text not tied to a labeled field (e.g., \"Invoice\", \"Professional Service Invoice\", slogans, theme names, \"@handles\", websites).\n",
      "- Prefer explicitly labeled values over inference. If no acceptable label exists for a field, leave it \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "SECTION BREAKS AND BLOCK CAPTURE:\n",
      "- When capturing multi‑line blocks (BILLED_TO or COMPANY/PAY TO), stop at the next clear section label or a blank line to avoid bleeding into unrelated sections.\n",
      "- Treat the following as section breaks (case‑insensitive): \"Description\", \"Item\", \"TOTAL\", \"TOTAL DUE\", \"SUBTOTAL\", \"SUB‑TOTAL\", \"TAX\", \"TAX RATE\", \"DISCOUNT\", \"BANK\", \"Bank Details\", \"Payment\", \"Payment Method\", \"PAYMENT METHOD\", \"Terms\", \"Notes\", \"TERMS\", \"NOTES\", \"PAY TO\", \"Pay To\", \"From\", \"Freelancer\", \"Company\", \"Invoice #\", \"Invoice No\", \"INVOICE NO\", \"Invoice Date\", \"Date\", \"Due Date\", \"Authorized Signature\", \"Authorized Signed\", \"Pay by\", \"INVOICE\".\n",
      "- If a line contains both customer info and a labeled date (e.g., \"... A : 123 ... Date : 12/07/2023\"), split at \"Date :\" — the date belongs to INVOICE_DATE and must not be included in BILLED_TO.\n",
      "\n",
      "FIELD‑SPECIFIC RULES AND LABEL VARIANTS:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) INVOICE_NUMBER\n",
      "   - Accept labels (case‑insensitive): \"Invoice Number\", \"Invoice No\", \"Invoice No.\", \"Invoice NO.\", \"Invoice #\", \"INVOICE NO.\", \"INVOICE NO\", \"INV#\", \"Invoice ID\", \"Invoice#\", \"INV No\", \"INV No.\", \"No\", \"No.\", \"No:\" when clearly used as the invoice identifier (especially near the main invoice header/metadata).\n",
      "   - Also accept a standalone number prefixed with \"#\" near the main INVOICE header.\n",
      "   - Capture the value on the same line or the next non‑empty line (including stacked/column layouts).\n",
      "   - Strip a leading \"#\" from the captured value; preserve other punctuation/hyphens (e.g., \"INV-00008\", \"2000-15\", \"001\").\n",
      "   - If multiple candidates exist, prefer one explicitly labeled with \"Invoice ...\" over a generic \"No\". If still ambiguous, choose the one closest to the main invoice header.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) INVOICE_DATE\n",
      "   - Preferred labels (highest to lowest): \"Invoice Date\", \"Date of Issue\", \"Issue Date\", \"Date Issued\", \"Date\".\n",
      "   - If using generic \"Date\", ensure it represents the issuing date (header/metadata) and is not a due/service/delivery date.\n",
      "   - Exclude non‑issuing dates such as \"Service Date\", \"Due Date\", \"Payment Due\", \"Pay by\", \"Delivery Date\".\n",
      "   - If the label and value are on separate lines, capture the next non‑empty line; in stacked header layouts, map in order to the matching value.\n",
      "   - If a date value line accidentally contains extra trailing non‑date text (e.g., \"23 March 2025INVOICE\"), capture only the date substring and stop before the trailing non‑date token (\"23 March 2025\").\n",
      "   - Keep the date format exactly as written.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) BILLED_TO\n",
      "   - The customer/recipient (not the sender).\n",
      "   - Labels to match (case‑insensitive): \"Bill To\", \"Billed To\", \"Invoice To\", \"INVOICE TO\", \"Invoice to\", \"To:\", \"Customer\", \"Client\".\n",
      "   - Capture that block’s lines until a clear section break or blank line. Do not include subsequent labels/sections.\n",
      "   - Important: stop the BILLED_TO block at any \"Date\"/\"Invoice Date\"/\"Date of Issue\" label; if a \"Date\" segment appears on the same physical line, split at \"Date\" and exclude it from BILLED_TO.\n",
      "   - Return a single string combining the block’s lines joined with \", \". Trim extra spaces/commas. Preserve internal labels like \"Phone:\", \"Email:\" if present inside the billed‑to block.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) COMPANY\n",
      "   - The issuing/seller (the party sending the invoice).\n",
      "   - Preferred sources/labels (case‑insensitive): \"From\", \"Company\", \"Seller\", \"Vendor\", \"Supplier\", \"Issuer\", \"PAY TO\", \"Pay To\", \"Payable to\", \"Remit To\", \"Remittance To\", \"Beneficiary\", \"Beneficiary Name\", \"Freelancer\", \"Service Provider\".\n",
      "   - If a \"PAY TO\"/\"Payable to\"/\"Remit To\"/\"Beneficiary\" block exists, extract the entity listed there; if both a person and a company appear, choose the company name.\n",
      "   - Do NOT infer the company from decorative/template headers or theme text (e.g., \"Green IT Company Professional Service Invoice\", \"INVOICEBorcelle\") unless they appear within an explicit seller/Pay To/From block.\n",
      "   - If no explicit seller/company block can be identified via the labels above, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "5) TOTAL_AMOUNT\n",
      "   - The final amount payable (grand/final total).\n",
      "   - Accept and prioritize explicit grand‑total labels (case‑insensitive): \"TOTAL DUE\", \"AMOUNT DUE\", \"BALANCE DUE\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT DUE\", \"Grand Total\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT\", \"TOTAL\".\n",
      "   - Selection rules when multiple candidates exist:\n",
      "     - Prefer \"TOTAL DUE\"/\"AMOUNT DUE\"/\"BALANCE DUE\"/\"TOTAL AMOUNT DUE\" over a plain \"TOTAL\", even if the plain \"TOTAL\" appears in the item summary.\n",
      "     - Otherwise, prefer totals that appear in the end‑of‑invoice summary area directly after any subtotal/tax/discount lines.\n",
      "     - The amount should appear on the same line as the grand‑total label; if not, take the nearest following non‑empty amount line.\n",
      "     - Do not pick a number purely because it is largest; rely on labels and placement.\n",
      "   - Normalize spacing between any currency symbol and digits if needed (e.g., \"$ 550\" -> \"$550\").\n",
      "\n",
      "6) BANK_NAME\n",
      "   - Labels (case‑insensitive): \"Bank Name\", or \"Bank\" when used as a label.\n",
      "   - Accept:\n",
      "     - \"Bank Name: XYZ\" (or split across lines, including \"Bank\" on one line and \"Name\" on the next),\n",
      "     - a lone \"Bank\" line followed by the bank name on the next line,\n",
      "     - or a standalone bank name line ending with \"Bank\" when clearly within a payment/bank details section.\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "7) ACCOUNT_NAME\n",
      "   - Labels (case‑insensitive): \"Account Name\", \"A/C Name\", \"Account Holder\", \"Account Holder Name\", \"Beneficiary Name\".\n",
      "   - Also accept a lone \"Name\" when it appears within a bank/payment details block adjacent to bank/account labels.\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "8) ACCOUNT_NUMBER\n",
      "   - Labels (case‑insensitive): \"Account Number\", \"Account No\", \"Account No.\", \"Acct No\", \"Acct No.\", \"Account #\", \"Acct #\", \"A/C No\", \"A/C No.\", \"A/C Number\", \"A/C #\", \"Bank Account\", \"Bank A/C\".\n",
      "   - Also accept \"Account\" (without \"No/Number/#\") only when it appears inside a bank/payment details block alongside other bank labels (e.g., Bank/Name) and clearly denotes the account number.\n",
      "   - Preserve dashes and spaces as they appear (e.g., \"0012-3456-7890\", \"0123 4567 8901\").\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "ADDITIONAL DISAMBIGUATION:\n",
      "- When both billed‑to and from/company blocks share similar address/email, keep them distinct: BILLED_TO is the customer/recipient; COMPANY is the issuer/seller.\n",
      "- Avoid using standalone brand words near \"INVOICE\" (e.g., \"INVOICEBorcelle\") as COMPANY unless they appear within a labeled seller block.\n",
      "- For lines that accidentally concatenate a header word to a value (e.g., \"23 March 2025INVOICE\"), capture only the intended value substring (\"23 March 2025\") and ignore the trailing header token.\n",
      "- For all fields, capture the nearest following non‑empty value when a label and its value are split across lines or columns.\n",

      "- Ignore decorative/tagline/template text not tied to a labeled field (e.g., \"Invoice\", \"Professional Service Invoice\", \"Cleaning Invoice Template\", theme names, taglines).\n",
      "- Prefer explicitly labeled values over inference. If no acceptable label exists for a field, leave it \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Field-specific rules and robust label variants:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) INVOICE_NUMBER\n",
      "   - Accept labels (case-insensitive): \"Invoice Number\", \"Invoice No\", \"Invoice No.\", \"Invoice NO.\", \"Invoice #\", \"INVOICE NO.\", \"INVOICE NO\", \"INV#\", \"Invoice ID\", \"Invoice#\", \"INV No\", \"INV No.\", and also generic \"No\", \"No.\", \"No:\" when clearly used as the invoice identifier (especially near the main invoice header).\n",
      "   - Also accept a standalone number prefixed with \"#\" near the main INVOICE header.\n",
      "   - Capture the value on the same line or the next non-empty line.\n",
      "   - Strip a leading \"#\" from the captured value; preserve other punctuation/hyphens (e.g., \"INV-00008\", \"2000-15\", \"001\").\n",
      "   - If multiple candidates exist, prefer one explicitly labeled with \"Invoice ...\" over a generic \"No\". If still ambiguous, choose the one closest to the main invoice header.\n",
      "   - Do not use PO numbers, customer numbers, or unrelated \"No:\" values.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) INVOICE_DATE\n",
      "   - Preferred labels (highest to lowest): \"Invoice Date\", \"Date of Issue\", \"Issue Date\", \"Date Issued\", \"Date\", \"date:\".\n",
      "   - If using the generic \"Date\", ensure it is not part of or inside the BILLED_TO/customer block; prefer a date located in the header/summary area associated with invoice metadata.\n",
      "   - Exclude non-issuing dates such as \"Service Date\", \"Due Date\", \"Payment Due\", \"Pay by\", \"Delivery Date\".\n",
      "   - When the label and value are on separate lines (e.g., \"DATE OF ISSUE\" followed by a date on the next line), capture the next non-empty line.\n",
      "   - Keep the format exactly as written (e.g., \"15/08/2028\", \"01 / 02 / 2023\", \"12.06.2024\").\n",
      "\n",
      "3) BILLED_TO\n",
      "   - This is the customer/recipient (not the sender).\n",
      "   - Labels to match (case-insensitive): \"Bill To\", \"Billed To\", \"Invoice To\", \"Invoice to\", \"To:\", \"Customer\", \"Client\", \"INVOICE TO\".\n",
      "   - Start the block at the matched label line but DO NOT include the starting block label text itself in the value. Begin the value from the first content line after the label (e.g., for \"Customer: Sparkle Clean\", the value starts with \"Sparkle Clean\").\n",
      "   - Capture that block’s lines until a clear section break: a blank line, or the start of another major section/label. Treat the following as breaks (case-insensitive): \"Description\", \"Item\", \"TOTAL\", \"TOTAL DUE\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT\", \"SUBTOTAL\", \"SUB-TOTAL\", \"TAX\", \"TAX RATE\", \"DISCOUNT\", \"BANK\", \"Bank\", \"Bank Details\", \"TERMS\", \"NOTES\", \"PAY TO\", \"From\", \"Freelancer\", \"Company\", \"Invoice #\", \"Invoice No\", \"INVOICE NO\", \"Date\", \"Due Date\", \"Payment Method\", \"PAYMENT METHOD\", \"Authorized Signature\", \"Authorized Signed\", \"Pay by\".\n",
      "   - Important: stop the BILLED_TO block at any \"Date\"/\"Invoice Date\"/\"Date of Issue\" line; do not include date lines inside BILLED_TO.\n",
      "   - Return a single string combining the block’s lines joined with \", \". Trim extra spaces/commas. Keep internal sublabels like \"Phone:\" and \"Email:\" if they are inside the billed-to block.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) COMPANY\n",
      "   - The issuing/seller (the party sending the invoice).\n",
      "   - Preferred sources/labels (case-insensitive): \"From\", \"Company\", \"Seller\", \"Vendor\", \"Supplier\", \"Issuer\", \"PAY TO\", \"Pay To\", \"Freelancer\", \"Service Provider\".\n",
      "   - If a \"PAY TO\" block exists, extract the entity name from there; if both a person and a company are listed (e.g., a personal name and a company like \"Wardi LLC\"), choose the company (\"Wardi LLC\"); otherwise use the person’s name.\n",
      "   - Do NOT infer the company from decorative/template headers or themes (e.g., \"Green IT Company Professional Service Invoice\", \"Cleaning Invoice Template\", \"Freelance Invoice Template\").\n",
      "   - If no explicit seller/company block can be identified via the labels above, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "5) TOTAL_AMOUNT\n",
      "   - The final amount payable (grand/final total).\n",
      "   - Prefer explicit grand-total labels (case-insensitive): \"TOTAL\", \"TOTAL:\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT DUE\", \"AMOUNT DUE\", \"BALANCE DUE\", \"Grand Total\", \"TOTAL DUE\".\n",
      "   - Exclude \"SUBTOTAL\"/\"SUB-TOTAL\", \"TAX\", \"Tax Rate\", \"Discount\", per-line item totals, and intermediate totals.\n",
      "   - Ignore column headers like \"DESCRIPTION QTY TOTAL\" or table headings; do not take amounts associated with headers.\n",
      "   - Selection rules when multiple candidates exist:\n",
      "     - The amount should appear on the same line as the grand-total label; if not, take the nearest following non-empty amount line.\n",
      "     - Prefer totals that appear in the end-of-invoice summary area directly adjacent to/after any subtotal/tax/discount lines (the itemized summary).\n",
      "     - If multiple grand-total-style labels exist (e.g., both \"TOTAL\" and \"TOTAL AMOUNT DUE\"), choose the one positioned with or immediately following the subtotal/tax/discount block rather than a standalone or decorative header elsewhere.\n",
      "     - If a \"TOTAL\" label has no adjacent amount and is immediately followed by unrelated headers/sections, fall back to the closest explicit grand-total-style label in the summary area (e.g., \"TOTAL AMOUNT\", \"AMOUNT DUE\"). Do not pick a number purely because it is largest.\n",
      "   - The captured amount must look like a payable currency/amount (e.g., \"$550\", \"$460.00\", \"€1,234.56\"); do not capture percentages like \"10%\".\n",
      "\n",
      "6) BANK_NAME\n",
      "   - Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Bank Name\", or \"Bank\" when used as a label.\n",
      "   - Accept \"Bank Name: XYZ\" or a lone \"Bank\" line followed by the bank name on the next line.\n",
      "   - Additionally, handle the common reverse ordering seen in templates: if a standalone plausible bank name line (e.g., \"Borcelle Bank\") is immediately followed by a label line \"Bank\" or \"Bank Name\", treat the preceding line as the bank name.\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "7) ACCOUNT_NAME\n",
      "   - Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Account Name\", \"Account name\", \"A/C Name\".\n",
      "   - Also handle reverse ordering: if a person/company name line is immediately followed by \"Account Name\" or \"A/C Name\", use the preceding line as the account name.\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "8) ACCOUNT_NUMBER\n",
      "   - Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Account Number\", \"Account No\", \"Account No.\", \"Acct No\", \"Acct No.\", \"Account #\", \"Acct #\", \"A/C No\", \"A/C No.\", \"A/C Number\", \"A/C #\".\n",
      "   - Preserve dashes and spaces as they appear (e.g., \"0012-3456-7890\", \"0123 4567 8901\").\n",
      "   - Also handle reverse ordering: if a line with a plausible account number immediately precedes a label line from the list above (e.g., number then \"Account No\"), treat the preceding line as the account number.\n",
      "   - Do NOT use \"Bank Account\" or plain \"Account\" as a substitute label unless it explicitly includes \"No\", \"Number\", or \"#\".\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional guidance and disambiguation:\n",
      "- When capturing multi-line blocks (BILLED_TO or PAY TO/FROM), stop at the next clear header/section label or a blank line to avoid bleeding into unrelated sections (e.g., \"Description\", \"Terms\", \"Bank Details\", \"Payment Method\", \"Authorized Signed\", \"Thank you\", \"Date\").\n",
      "- If both billed-to and from/company blocks share the same address/email, still keep them distinct: BILLED_TO is the customer/recipient; COMPANY is the issuer/seller.\n",
      "- Prefer explicit labels over inference; if no acceptable label is found for a field, output \"\" rather than guessing from a generic header.\n",
      "- Avoid using standalone brand words near \"INVOICE\" (e.g., \"INVOICEBorcelle\") as COMPANY unless they appear within a labeled \"From\"/\"PAY TO\"/company block.\n",
      "\n",
      "Common pitfalls to avoid:\n",
      "- Output must be valid JSON (double quotes around keys and values). Do not use single quotes or Python dict syntax.\n",
      "- Do not include the starting block label itself in BILLED_TO (e.g., exclude \"Customer:\"/\"Billed To:\" from the value).\n",
      "- Ignore \"TOTAL\" in column headers (e.g., \"DESCRIPTION QTY TOTAL\"); use the grand total in the summary area near Subtotal/Tax/Discount.\n",
      "- When a total label is on its own line and the amount is on the next line, capture the next currency amount (skip intervening percentage lines like \"10%\").\n",

      "- Decorative headers to ignore as values: lines that are just “INVOICE”, “THANK YOU”, template/theme names like “YOUR LOGO”, “INVOICE TEMPLATE”, etc.\n",
      "- Known label/header cues (case-insensitive, not exhaustive):\n",
      "  - Invoice number labels: \"Invoice Number\", \"Invoice No\", \"Invoice No.\", \"Invoice NO.\", \"Invoice #\", \"INVOICE NO.\", \"INVOICE NO\", \"INV#\", \"Invoice ID\".\n",
      "  - Also consider contextual \"No\" variants — see INVOICE_NUMBER rules below.\n",
      "  - Date labels (preference order): \"Invoice Date\", \"Date of Issue\", \"Issue Date\", \"Date Issued\", then \"Date\".\n",
      "  - Recipient blocks: \"Bill To\", \"Billed To\", \"Invoice To\", \"To:\", \"Customer\", \"Client\".\n",
      "  - Sender blocks: \"From\", \"Company\", \"Seller\", \"Vendor\", \"Supplier\", \"Issuer\", \"Freelancer\", \"PAY TO\", \"Pay to\", \"Payable to\".\n",
      "  - Financial summary labels: \"TOTAL\", \"TOTAL:\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT DUE\", \"AMOUNT DUE\", \"BALANCE DUE\", \"Grand Total\", \"TOTAL DUE\".\n",

      "\n",
      "Label-value placement rules:\n",
      "- A label’s value may be:\n",
      "  - on the same line after the label (e.g., \"Invoice Date: 04/01/2023\"),\n",

      "- When label and value are separated by line breaks:\n",
      "  - The “value line” is the nearest following non-empty line that is not itself a label line and not a decorative header.\n",
      "  - If the next line is another label (ends with \":\" or matches a known label), skip it and continue to the next plausible non-label line.\n",
      "  - For date labels specifically, you may scan forward up to the next 3 non-empty lines to find a date-like value; skip intervening label lines and decorative headers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Detection helpers:\n",
      "- Date-like values: dd/mm/yyyy, dd.mm.yyyy, mm/dd/yyyy, yyyy-mm-dd, “5 December 2030”, “10 Sep 2024”, etc.\n",
      "- Currency amounts: currency symbol + amount (e.g., \"$1,234.56\", \"€ 1.234,56\" → normalize space after symbol only), or plain amounts with decimals when clearly aligned to a total label.\n",
      "- A “label line” is a line that ends with \":\" or exactly matches a known label phrase.\n",

      "- Contextual acceptance of generic \"No\"/\"NO\"/\"No.\" labels:\n",
      "  - You may accept \"No\", \"NO\", \"No.\", \"NO.\" as an invoice-number label IF AND ONLY IF:\n",
      "    - it is in the invoice metadata/header area (before the items table and near other header metadata like Date), and\n",
      "    - it is not part of a table column (e.g., \"No.\" alongside \"Description Qty Price Total\") and not a banking phrase (e.g., \"No Bank\"), and\n",
      "    - the value looks like an invoice identifier (e.g., includes “INV”, alphanumerics with hyphens, or a non-trivial code like \"INV-12345-1\", \"2000-15\", \"001\").\n",
      "  - Prefer explicit invoice-number labels over generic \"No\" if both exist.\n",
      "- Banner-adjacent fallback: a standalone number prefixed with \"#\" can be accepted ONLY if it is clearly adjacent to the main INVOICE header area (on the same line as a prominent \"INVOICE\" banner or within the next 1–2 lines under a standalone \"INVOICE\" banner) and not tied to another label.\n",
      "- If the captured value starts with a single leading “#”, strip that one leading “#” (keep the rest).\n",
      "- Preserve internal punctuation/hyphens (e.g., “INV-00008”, “2000-15”, “001”).\n",
      "\n",
      "2) INVOICE_DATE\n",
      "- Use the first available, most specific label in this priority order: \"Invoice Date\" > \"Date of Issue\" > \"Issue Date\" > \"Date Issued\" > \"Date\".\n",
      "- If both a general \"Date\" and a more specific variant appear, use the more specific one tied to the invoice.\n",
      "- Exclude dates that are inside the BILLED_TO block (see BILLED_TO boundaries).\n",
      "- If the value line contains extra concatenated text, keep only the date portion (e.g., trim \"23 March 2025INVOICE\" to \"23 March 2025\").\n",
      "- If no date label is present, you may use a single standalone date near the main invoice header/totals only if it is clearly associated with the invoice and not within recipient/sender blocks; otherwise leave \"\".\n",
      "- Do NOT derive the date from lines like “NO. 001 02.05.2024” unless a valid date label is present on that same line.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) BILLED_TO\n",
      "- The customer/recipient (not the sender).\n",
      "- Find blocks labeled by: \"Bill To\", \"Billed To\", \"Invoice To\", \"To:\", \"Customer\", \"Client\".\n",
      "- Capture subsequent lines starting after the label until a clear break:\n",
      "  - a blank line, OR\n",
      "  - the start of another labeled section/header (e.g., \"Description\", \"Subtotal\", \"Tax\", \"Discount\", any final total label, \"Bank\"/\"Bank Details\", \"Terms\", \"PAY TO\"/\"Payable to\", \"From\", \"Company\", standalone \"DATE\", any invoice number/date/due-date labels).\n",
      "- If a “Date …” appears on the same line as BILLED_TO info, exclude the “Date …” part from BILLED_TO; consider it for INVOICE_DATE if it follows a valid date label.\n",
      "- Join captured lines with \", \", trimming extra spaces/commas. Keep in-block contact labels like “Phone:” or “Email:” if they appear inside the block.\n",
      "- Fallback only if the labeled block is otherwise empty: if a single unambiguous recipient name appears within the next few lines before another major section and is not clearly the sender, use it; else leave \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "4) COMPANY\n",
      "- The issuer/seller (party sending the invoice).\n",
      "- Preferred sources (in priority):\n",
      "  1) A clear brand/company name near the main INVOICE header/top banner that looks like a company/brand (contains “Inc”, “LLC”, “Ltd”, “Company”, “Co.”, “Agency”, “Studio”, “GmbH”, “Pvt”, “Limited”, or a distinctive business name). Many templates include the issuer brand in the title (e.g., “Green IT Company Professional Service Invoice” → COMPANY = “Green IT Company”).\n",
      "  2) Explicit sender blocks: \"From\", \"Company\", \"Seller\", \"Vendor\", \"Supplier\", \"Issuer\", \"Freelancer\", \"PAY TO\", \"Pay to\", \"Payable to\".\n",
      "- If a sender block lists both a person and a company, prefer the distinct company/brand name (e.g., “Timmerman Industries”) over the person’s name, unless the person is clearly the brand and no distinct company name is present.\n",
      "- If the PAY TO block mostly contains payment instructions (address, bank, account) and a different clear brand appears in the header, prefer the header brand.\n",
      "- Do NOT use generic/template titles as the company (e.g., “Freelance Invoice Template”, “INVOICE/TAX RECEIPT”, “YOUR LOGO”).\n",
      "- If no explicit issuer/company can be identified, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "5) TOTAL_AMOUNT\n",
      "- Accept only amounts tied to one of these final total labels (case-insensitive): \"TOTAL\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT DUE\", \"AMOUNT DUE\", \"BALANCE DUE\", \"Grand Total\", \"TOTAL DUE\".\n",
      "- Selection rules when multiple candidates exist:\n",
      "  - Prefer totals that appear in the financial summary area after the itemized section, often near “Subtotal/Tax/Discount”.\n",
      "  - Avoid using “Total” that is part of table headers like “Description Qty Price Total”.\n",
      "  - Avoid early banner or header “Total …” lines if a later valid final total exists in the summary area.\n",
      "  - Prefer the amount on the same line as the final total label; if not present, take the nearest following amount line on the next 1–2 non-empty lines.\n",
      "  - If both an early “Total Amount” and a later “TOTAL/Grand Total/Amount Due/BALANCE DUE” exist, choose the later one in the summary section.\n",
      "  - Prefer the last (bottom-most) valid final total label in the document.\n",
      "- Exclude subtotals, taxes, discounts, per-line totals, and detached banner totals.\n",
      "- Normalize only the space right after a currency symbol (e.g., \"$ 3,045.60\" → \"$3,045.60\").\n",
      "\n",
      "6) BANK_NAME\n",
      "- Value following labels: \"Bank Name\" or \"Bank\".\n",
      "- Forward-stacked: label line then next plausible non-label value line (skipping lines that are labels or just “:”).\n",
      "- Reverse-stacked: if no suitable forward value is found for the encountered label, take the immediately preceding non-empty non-label line as the value (prefer a bank-like string).\n",
      "- Prefer a bank-like value (contains words like \"Bank\", \"Banc\", \"Credit Union\", \"Trust\", \"N.A.\", \"N.A\", \"Ltd.\", \"PLC\", etc.).\n",
      "- If the immediate next line is itself a label (ends with \":\" or is a known label like \"Name\", \"Account\"), skip it and continue to the next plausible value line within the bank details area.\n",
      "- Ignore misleading phrases like \"No Bank\" as a value; look for the actual bank name on the next/previous eligible line.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) ACCOUNT_NAME\n",
      "- Value following labels: \"Account Name\" or \"A/C Name\".\n",
      "- Also support reverse-stacked capture (value is the immediately preceding non-empty non-label line).\n",
      "- Prefer a person or organization name; avoid picking bank-like values.\n",
      "- Do NOT accept \"Name\" alone or \"Pay to\"/\"Payable to\" as substitutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "8) ACCOUNT_NUMBER\n",
      "- Value following labels: \"Account Number\", \"Account No\", \"Account No.\", \"Acct No\", \"A/C No\", \"A/C Number\".\n",
      "- Also support reverse-stacked capture where the value is the immediately preceding non-empty non-label line.\n",
      "- Preserve dashes and spaces in the number exactly.\n",
      "- Do NOT accept \"Account\" alone, \"Bank Account\", or ambiguous abbreviations like \"Acc:\" without “No”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional disambiguation and stopping rules:\n",
      "- Keep BILLED_TO and COMPANY distinct based on their own labeled sections, even if they share address/email lines.\n",
      "- For multi-line blocks (BILLED_TO or sender/PAY TO), stop at the next clear header/section label or a blank line to avoid bleeding into unrelated text (e.g., “Description”, “Terms”, “Bank Details”, standalone “DATE”, totals labels).\n",
      "- Avoid misreading nearby “No.”, “NO.”, “No Items”, or “NO.” in tables as an invoice number unless explicitly serving as an invoice identifier per INVOICE_NUMBER rules.\n",
      "- Avoid including banner words like “INVOICE” adjacent to captured values.\n",
      "- Banner-adjacent “#12345” may be used for INVOICE_NUMBER only if it is clearly under or on the INVOICE header.\n",
      "- When matching a date, do not harvest dates inferred from unlabeled “NO. 001 02.05.2024”-style lines; these are ambiguous unless accompanied by a valid date label on that line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Implementation tips:\n",

Extract only the number-like token for INVOICE_NUMBER (e.g., \"001\") and the date-like token for INVOICE_DATE (e.g., \"02.05.2024\").\n",

      "- Strip a leading \"#\" from the captured value; preserve other punctuation/hyphens (e.g., \"INV-00008\", \"2000-15\", \"001\").\n",
      "- If multiple candidates exist, prefer one explicitly labeled with \"Invoice ...\" over a generic \"No/No.\" If still ambiguous, choose the one closest to the main invoice header. Never take \"NO.\" from a table header row.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) INVOICE_DATE\n",
      "- Preferred labels (highest to lowest): \"Invoice Date\", \"Date of Issue\", \"Issue Date\", \"Date Issued\", then a generic \"Date\".\n",
      "- Only use a generic \"Date\" if it is clearly in the invoice metadata/header area (near \"Invoice\" title, invoice number, sender/recipient header) and NOT inside or near signature/payment/bank/notes sections. Do NOT use a \"Date\" that appears alongside \"Signature\", \"Payment Method\", \"Notes\", \"Bank\", \"Thank you\", or at the very bottom footer.\n",
      "- If the label and value are on separate lines, capture the next non-empty line only if it matches a date-like pattern.\n",
      "- Accept date-like patterns such as:\n",
      "  - DD/MM/YYYY, D/M/YYYY (with or without leading zeros)\n",
      "  - DD.MM.YYYY\n",
      "  - DD-MM-YYYY\n",
      "  - YYYY-MM-DD\n",
      "  - Month DD, YYYY (e.g., \"Aug 15, 2028\" or \"August 15, 2028\")\n",
      "  - DD Mon YYYY / DD Month YYYY (e.g., \"15 Aug 2028\")\n",
      "- If a single header line includes both invoice number and date (e.g., \"NO. 001 02.05.2024\"), it is valid to take the date part for INVOICE_DATE.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) BILLED_TO\n",
      "- This is the customer/recipient (not the sender).\n",
      "- Labels to match (case-insensitive): \"Bill To\", \"Billed To\", \"Invoice To\", \"Invoice to\", \"To:\", \"Customer\", \"Client\", \"INVOICE TO\".\n",
      "- Also handle paired headings like \"FROM: TO:\". In such cases, capture the block that belongs to \"TO:\" (the recipient), per the two-column rules above.\n",
      "- Capture the block’s lines until a clear section break (see break list above). Do not include invoice metadata (Invoice No, Date) or totals/bank/terms lines.\n",
      "- Important: stop the BILLED_TO block at any \"Date\"/\"Invoice Date\"/\"Date of Issue\" line; do not include date lines inside BILLED_TO.\n",
      "- Return a single string combining the block’s lines joined with \", \". Trim extra spaces/commas. Keep internal labels like \"Phone:\"/\"Email:\" if they are inside the billed-to block.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) COMPANY\n",
      "- The issuing/seller (the party sending the invoice).\n",
      "- Preferred sources/labels in this priority order (case-insensitive):\n",
      "  1) \"PAY TO\"/\"Pay To\" block (if present)\n",
      "  2) \"From\"\n",
      "  3) \"Seller\", \"Vendor\", \"Supplier\", \"Issuer\", \"Freelancer\", \"Service Provider\"\n",
      "- If a \"PAY TO\" block exists, extract the entity from there; if both a person and a company are listed (e.g., a personal name and a company like \"Wardi LLC\"), choose the company (\"Wardi LLC\"); otherwise use the person’s name.\n",
      "- If \"FROM: TO:\" appears, take the entity associated with \"FROM:\" as COMPANY, and \"TO:\" as BILLED_TO (use two-column rules if interleaved).\n",
      "- Do NOT infer the company from decorative/template headers or themes (e.g., \"Green IT Company Professional Service Invoice\", \"Freelance Invoice Template\", color/theme names).\n",
      "- If no explicit seller/company block can be identified via the labels above, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "5) TOTAL_AMOUNT\n",
      "- The final amount payable (grand/final total). Do not calculate or infer from line items.\n",
      "- Accept explicit grand-total labels (case-insensitive): \"TOTAL\", \"TOTAL:\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT DUE\", \"AMOUNT DUE\", \"BALANCE DUE\", \"Grand Total\", \"TOTAL DUE\".\n",
      "- Selection and placement rules:\n",
      "  - The amount should be on the same line as the grand-total label; if not, take the immediately next non-empty amount line only if it is still within the totals summary area.\n",
      "  - The grand total should appear in the end-of-invoice summary area, directly adjacent to or after any Subtotal/Tax/Discount lines (the itemized summary). Prefer totals that appear after the items table, not above or within the item list.\n",
      "  - If both an early \"Total Amount\" (appearing near/within the item list) and a later \"TOTAL/TOTAL DUE/AMOUNT DUE\" exist, choose the one positioned with (or immediately after) the Subtotal/Tax/Discount block near the end of the invoice.\n",
      "  - Do NOT backtrack from a \"Total\"/\"Total Amount\" label to earlier amounts. If a \"Total\" label has no adjacent amount and the next non-empty line is a non-amount or a section header (e.g., \"Payment Method\", \"Notes\", \"Bank\"), do not pair it with distant amounts; instead, look for another valid grand-total label in the summary area. If none exists, return \"\".\n",
      "  - Do not pick a number purely because it is the largest.\n",
      "- Normalize spacing between any currency symbol and digits if needed (e.g., \"$ 550\" -> \"$550\").\n",
      "\n",
      "6) BANK_NAME\n",
      "- Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Bank Name\", or \"Bank\" when used as a field label (not just a section header like \"Bank Details\").\n",
      "- Accept \"Bank Name: XYZ\" or a lone \"Bank\" line followed by the bank name on the next non-empty line.\n",
      "- If the next line after \"Bank\"/\"Bank Name\" is not a plausible bank name (e.g., it’s an amount, header, or unrelated), ignore it and leave BANK_NAME as \"\".\n",
      "- If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "7) ACCOUNT_NAME\n",
      "- Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Account Name\", \"Account name\", \"A/C Name\".\n",
      "- Do not infer from nearby personal/company names without an explicit label.\n",
      "- If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "8) ACCOUNT_NUMBER\n",
      "- Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Account Number\", \"Account No\", \"Account No.\", \"Acct No\", \"Acct No.\", \"Account #\", \"Acct #\", \"A/C No\", \"A/C No.\", \"A/C Number\", \"A/C #\".\n",
      "- Preserve dashes and spaces as they appear (e.g., \"0012-3456-7890\", \"0123 4567 8901\").\n",
      "- Do NOT use \"Bank Account\" or plain \"Account\" or \"Acc:\" as a substitute label unless it explicitly includes \"No\", \"Number\", or \"#\".\n",
      "- If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional guidance and tie-breakers:\n",
      "- When capturing multi-line blocks (BILLED_TO or PAY TO/FROM), stop at the next clear header/section label or a blank line to avoid bleeding into unrelated sections (e.g., \"Description\", \"Terms\", \"Bank Details\", \"Payment Method\", \"Authorized Signed\", \"Thank you\", \"Date\").\n",
      "- If both billed-to and from/company blocks share the same address/email, still keep them distinct: BILLED_TO is the customer/recipient; COMPANY is the issuer/seller.\n",
      "- Prefer explicit labels over inference; if no acceptable label is found for a field, output \"\" rather than guessing from a generic header.\n",
      "- Avoid using standalone brand words near \"INVOICE\" (e.g., \"INVOICEBorcelle\") as COMPANY unless they appear within a labeled \"From\"/\"PAY TO\"/company block.\n",
      "- INVOICE_NUMBER tie-breakers:\n",
      "  - If both a generic \"No:\" value and an explicit \"Invoice No.\" value exist, use the explicit \"Invoice No.\" value.\n",
      "  - Never take a \"No.\" from an items table header.\n",
      "- TOTAL_AMOUNT tie-breakers:\n",
      "  - If both \"TOTAL\" adjacent to the item summary and a separate \"TOTAL DUE\"/\"AMOUNT DUE\" amount appear elsewhere, choose the one that is with the itemized summary (subtotal/tax/discount context).\n",
      "  - If only one candidate has an adjacent currency amount, prefer that one.\n",
      "  - If no acceptable grand-total label with an adjacent amount is found in the summary area, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Return format reminder:\n",

      "- Header/metadata area: prioritize values found near the main INVOICE heading and before the items table headers (e.g., \"Description\", \"Item\", \"Qty/Quantity\", \"Rate/Price\", \"Amount\"). Avoid taking values from the items table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Important disambiguation and validation rules:\n",
      "- Reject table/column headers as labels. In particular, do NOT treat \"NO.\" in a header row like \"NO. DESCRIPTION RATE QTY TOTAL\" as the invoice number label.

      "- Combined header line (e.g., \"NO. 001 02.05.2024\"): it is valid to take the invoice number from the \"NO.\" portion and the date from the date-like portion. Extract only the number-like token for INVOICE_NUMBER (e.g., \"001\") and the date-like token for INVOICE_DATE (e.g., \"02.05.2024\").\n",
      "- When a label is followed by a value on the next line, verify the value type:\n",
      "  - For dates, the next non-empty line must match a date-like pattern; if it does not (e.g., it’s a person’s name), ignore that candidate and look for another labeled date.\n",
      "  - For bank/account fields, the next non-empty line must be text appropriate for that label (see field-specific labels below).\n",
      "- Do not accept unlabeled or loosely labeled account/bank details. For example, do NOT treat \"Acc:\", \"Account:\", or \"Bank Account:\" as “Account Number.” Only the explicit account-number variants listed below are acceptable.\n",
      "- Fused labels/values: If a grand-total label and amount are fused without a separator (e.g., \"$ 8987TOTAL\", \"TOTAL$8987\"), capture only the currency amount substring (normalize a space after the currency symbol if needed), not the label text.\n",
      "\n",
      "Field-specific rules and robust label variants:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) INVOICE_NUMBER\n",
      "   - Accept labels (case-insensitive): \"Invoice Number\", \"Invoice No\", \"Invoice No.\", \"Invoice NO.\", \"Invoice #\", \"INVOICE NO.\", \"INVOICE NO\", \"Invoice#\", \"INV#\", \"INV No\", \"INV No.\", \"Invoice ID\", and also generic \"No\", \"No.\", \"No:\" when clearly used as the invoice identifier (especially near the main invoice header and not in a table header).\n",
      "   - Also accept a standalone number prefixed with \"#\" near the main INVOICE header (e.g., \"#91028829\" -> \"91028829\").\n",
      "   - The value can be on the same line as the label or on the next non-empty line.\n",
      "   - If a line includes both an invoice number and a date (e.g., \"NO. 001 02.05.2024\"), capture only the number-like token for INVOICE_NUMBER (e.g., \"001\").\n",
      "   - Strip a leading \"#\" from the captured value; preserve other punctuation/hyphens (e.g., \"INV-00008\", \"2000-15\", \"001\").\n",
      "   - If multiple candidates exist, prefer one explicitly labeled with \"Invoice ...\" over a generic \"No/No.\" If still ambiguous, choose the one closest to the main invoice header. Never take \"NO.\" from a table header row.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) INVOICE_DATE\n",
      "   - Preferred labels (highest to lowest): \"Invoice Date\", \"Date of Issue\", \"Issue Date\", \"Date Issued\", \"Date\".\n",
      "   - If using the generic \"Date\", ensure it is not part of or inside the BILLED_TO/customer block. Prefer a date located in the header/summary area associated with invoice metadata.\n",
      "   - Exclude non-issuing dates such as \"Service Date\", \"Due Date\", \"Payment Due\", \"Pay by\", \"Delivery Date\".\n",
      "   - Unlabeled date in header: If no labeled invoice date is present, you may accept a standalone date-like token that appears in the main header/metadata area in close proximity to the invoice number or the INVOICE title, and not within the items table or other sections.\n",
      "   - Accept date-like patterns such as:\n",
      "     - DD/MM/YYYY, D/M/YYYY (with or without leading zeros)\n",
      "     - DD.MM.YYYY\n",
      "     - DD-MM-YYYY\n",
      "     - YYYY-MM-DD\n",
      "     - Month DD, YYYY (e.g., \"Aug 15, 2028\" or \"August 15, 2028\")\n",
      "     - DD Mon YYYY / DD Month YYYY (e.g., \"15 Aug 2028\")\n",
      "   - Keep the format exactly as written.\n",
      "   - If a single header line includes both invoice number and date (e.g., \"NO. 001 02.05.2024\"), it is valid to take the date part for INVOICE_DATE.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) BILLED_TO\n",
      "   - This is the customer/recipient (not the sender).\n",
      "   - Labels to match (case-insensitive): \"Bill To\", \"Billed To\", \"Invoice To\", \"INVOICE TO\", \"Invoice to\", \"To:\", \"Customer\", \"Client\".\n",
      "   - Also handle paired headings like \"FROM: TO:\". In such cases, capture the block that belongs to \"TO:\" (the recipient).\n",
      "   - Capture that block’s lines until a clear section break: a blank line, or the start of another major section/label. Treat the following as breaks (case-insensitive): \"Description\", \"Item\", \"TOTAL\", \"TOTAL DUE\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT DUE\", \"AMOUNT DUE\", \"SUBTOTAL\", \"SUB-TOTAL\", \"TAX\", \"TAX RATE\", \"DISCOUNT\", \"BANK\", \"Bank\", \"Bank Details\", \"TERMS\", \"NOTES\", \"PAY TO\", \"Please make payments to\", \"From\", \"Freelancer\", \"Company\", \"Vendor\", \"Invoice #\", \"Invoice No\", \"INVOICE NO\", \"Date\", \"Due Date\", \"Payment Method\", \"PAYMENT METHOD\", \"Authorized Signature\", \"Authorized Signed\", \"Pay by\".\n",
      "   - Important: stop the BILLED_TO block at any \"Date\"/\"Invoice Date\"/\"Date of Issue\" line; do not include date lines inside BILLED_TO.\n",
      "   - Return a single string combining the block’s lines joined with \", \". Trim extra spaces/commas. Keep internal labels like \"Phone:\"/\"Email:\" if they are inside the billed-to block.\n",
      "   - Edge-case layout: If a \"Billed To\"/\"Invoice To\"/\"Customer\"/\"Client\"/\"To:\" label appears but the next lines are unrelated headers or empty, and there is a contiguous recipient-like block immediately above that label (name/company and address/contact lines) separated from other sections, you may capture that immediately preceding block as BILLED_TO.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) COMPANY\n",
      "   - The issuing/seller (the party sending the invoice).\n",
      "   - Preferred sources/labels (case-insensitive): \"From\", \"Company\", \"Seller\", \"Vendor\", \"Supplier\", \"Issuer\", \"PAY TO\", \"Pay To\", \"Please make payments to\", \"Freelancer\", \"Service Provider\".\n",
      "   - If a \"PAY TO\" or \"Please make payments to\" block exists, extract the entity from there; if both a person and a company are listed, choose the company; otherwise use the person’s name.\n",
      "   - If \"FROM: TO:\" appears, take the entity associated with \"FROM:\" as COMPANY, and \"TO:\" as BILLED_TO.\n",
      "   - Do NOT infer the company from decorative/template headers or themes (e.g., \"Green IT Company Professional Service Invoice\", \"HVAC Invoice Template\", \"Yellow and Black Professional Company Invoice\"). Only use values found within an explicit seller/company/\"From\"/\"Pay To\" block. If no explicit seller/company block can be identified via the labels above, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "5) TOTAL_AMOUNT\n",
      "   - The final amount payable (grand/final total).\n",
      "   - Prefer explicit grand-total labels (case-insensitive): \"TOTAL\", \"TOTAL:\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT DUE\", \"AMOUNT DUE\", \"BALANCE DUE\", \"Grand Total\", \"TOTAL DUE\".\n",
      "   - The currency amount may be on the same line or the next non-empty line. If fused with the label (e.g., \"$8987TOTAL\" or \"TOTAL$8987\"), extract only the currency amount substring (normalize \"$ 8987\" -> \"$8987\").\n",
      "   - Exclude \"SUBTOTAL\"/\"SUB-TOTAL\", \"TAX\", \"Tax Rate\", \"Discount\", per-line item totals, and intermediate totals.\n",
      "   - Selection rules when multiple candidates exist:\n",
      "     - Prefer totals that appear in the end-of-invoice summary area directly adjacent to/after any subtotal/tax/discount lines (the itemized summary).\n",
      "     - When both an early \"Total Amount\" and a later \"TOTAL/TOTAL DUE\" exist, choose the one positioned with (or immediately after) the Subtotal/Tax/Discount block near the end of the invoice. Avoid totals that appear isolated within or above the item list.\n",
      "     - If a \"TOTAL\" label has no adjacent amount and is immediately followed by unrelated headers/sections, fall back to the closest explicit grand-total-style label in the summary area (e.g., \"TOTAL AMOUNT\", \"AMOUNT DUE\") that does have an adjacent amount. Do not pick a number purely because it is largest.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) BANK_NAME\n",
      "   - Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Bank Name\", or \"Bank\" when used as a field label (not a section header).\n",
      "   - Accept \"Bank Name: XYZ\", \"Bank: XYZ\", or a lone \"Bank\"/\"Bank Name\" line followed by the bank name on the next non-empty line.\n",
      "   - Preserve typos/spacing exactly as in source (e.g., \"Thynk Unl imited Bank\").\n",
      "\n",
      "7) ACCOUNT_NAME\n",
      "   - Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Account Name\", \"A/C Name\", \"Acct. Name\", \"Acct Name\".\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "8) ACCOUNT_NUMBER\n",
      "   - Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Account Number\", \"Account No\", \"Account No.\", \"Acct No\", \"Acct No.\", \"Account #\", \"Acct #\", \"A/C No\", \"A/C No.\", \"A/C Number\", \"A/C #\", \"Acct. No.\", \"Acct. #\".\n",
      "   - Preserve dashes and spaces as they appear (e.g., \"0012-3456-7890\", \"0123 4567 8901\").\n",
      "   - Do NOT use \"Bank Account\" or plain \"Account\" or \"Acc:\" as a substitute label unless it explicitly includes \"No\", \"Number\", or \"#\".\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional guidance and tie-breakers:\n",
      "- When capturing multi-line blocks (BILLED_TO or PAY TO/FROM), stop at the next clear header/section label or a blank line to avoid bleeding into unrelated sections (e.g., \"Description\", \"Terms\", \"Bank Details\", \"Payment Method\", \"Authorized Signed\", \"Thank you\", \"Date\").\n",
      "- If both billed-to and from/company blocks share the same address/email, still keep them distinct: BILLED_TO is the customer/recipient; COMPANY is the issuer/seller.\n",
      "- Prefer explicit labels over inference; if no acceptable label is found for a field, output \"\" rather than guessing from a generic header.\n",
      "- Avoid using standalone brand words near \"INVOICE\" (e.g., \"INVOICEBorcelle\") as COMPANY unless they appear within a labeled \"From\"/\"PAY TO\"/company block.\n",
      "- INVOICE_NUMBER tie-breakers:\n",
      "  - If both a generic \"No:\" value and an explicit \"Invoice No.\" value exist, use the explicit \"Invoice No.\" value.\n",
      "  - Never take a \"No.\" from an items table header.\n",
      "- TOTAL_AMOUNT tie-breakers:\n",
      "  - If both \"TOTAL\" adjacent to the item summary and a separate large \"TOTAL DUE\" amount appear elsewhere, choose the one that is with the itemized summary (subtotal/tax/discount context).\n",
      "  - If only one candidate has an adjacent currency amount, prefer that one.\n",

      "- Prefer explicitly labeled values over inference. If no acceptable label exists for a field, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Field-specific rules and robust label variants:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) INVOICE_NUMBER\n",
      "   - Accept labels (case-insensitive): \"Invoice Number\", \"Invoice No\", \"Invoice No.\", \"Invoice NO.\", \"Invoice #\", \"INVOICE NO.\", \"INVOICE NO\", \"INV#\", \"Invoice ID\", \"Invoice#\", \"INV No\", \"INV No.\", and generic \"No\", \"No.\", \"No:\" when clearly used as the invoice identifier (especially near the main invoice header).\n",
      "   - Also accept a standalone number prefixed with \"#\" that is presented near the main \"INVOICE\" header.\n",
      "   - Exclude unrelated IDs such as \"ACCOUNT ID\", \"Customer ID\", \"Order ID\" unless explicitly labeled as invoice identifiers.\n",
      "   - Capture the value on the same line or the next non-empty line.\n",
      "   - Strip a leading \"#\" from the captured value; preserve other punctuation/hyphens (e.g., \"INV-00008\", \"2000-15\", \"001\").\n",
      "   - If multiple candidates exist, prefer those explicitly labeled with \"Invoice ...\" over a generic \"No\". If still ambiguous, choose the one closest to the main invoice header.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) INVOICE_DATE\n",
      "   - Preferred labels (highest to lowest): \"Invoice Date\", \"Date of Issue\", \"DATE OF ISSUE\", \"Issue Date\", \"Date Issued\", \"Date\".\n",
      "   - If using the generic \"Date\", ensure it is an issuing date (not \"Due Date\", \"Service Date\", \"Delivery Date\", \"Payment Due\", \"Pay by\").\n",
      "   - If \"Date\" appears on the same line as customer info (e.g., in an \"Invoice To\"/\"Billed To\" area), you may still capture it as INVOICE_DATE as long as it is clearly labeled \"Date\" (not \"Due Date\"), and treat that \"Date\" fragment as separate metadata (do not include it in BILLED_TO).\n",
      "   - When the label and value are on separate lines (e.g., \"DATE OF ISSUE\" followed by a date on the next line), capture the next non-empty line.\n",
      "   - Keep the format exactly as written (e.g., \"15/08/2028\", \"01 / 02 / 2023\", \"12.06.2024\").\n",
      "\n",
      "3) BILLED_TO\n",
      "   - This is the customer/recipient (not the sender).\n",
      "   - Labels to match (case-insensitive): \"Bill To\", \"Billed To\", \"Invoice To\", \"Invoice to\", \"INVOICE TO\", \"To:\", \"Customer\", \"Client\".\n",
      "   - Capture that block’s lines until a clear section break: a blank line, or the start of another major section/label. Treat the following as breaks (case-insensitive): \"Description\", \"Item\", \"TOTAL\", \"TOTAL DUE\", \"SUBTOTAL\", \"SUB-TOTAL\", \"TAX\", \"TAX RATE\", \"DISCOUNT\", \"BANK\", \"Bank\", \"Bank Details\", \"TERMS\", \"NOTES\", \"PAY TO\", \"From\", \"Freelancer\", \"Company\", \"Invoice #\", \"Invoice No\", \"INVOICE NO\", \"Date\", \"Invoice Date\", \"Date of Issue\", \"Due Date\", \"Payment Method\", \"PAYMENT METHOD\", \"Authorized Signature\", \"Authorized Signed\", \"Pay by\".\n",
      "   - Important: stop the BILLED_TO block at any \"Date\"/\"Invoice Date\"/\"Date of Issue\"/\"Due Date\" line; do not include date lines inside BILLED_TO.\n",
      "   - Return a single string combining the block’s lines joined with \", \". Preserve internal labels like \"Phone:\", \"P:\", \"Email:\", \"E:\", \"A:\" if they are inside the billed-to block. Do not include the section label itself (e.g., don’t include \"BILLED TO:\" in the value).\n",
      "\n",
      "4) COMPANY\n",
      "   - The issuing/seller (the party sending the invoice).\n",
      "   - Preferred sources/labels (case-insensitive): \"From\", \"Company\", \"Seller\", \"Vendor\", \"Supplier\", \"Issuer\", \"PAY TO\", \"Pay To\", \"Freelancer\", \"Service Provider\".\n",
      "   - If a \"PAY TO\" block exists, extract the entity from there; if both a person and a company are listed (e.g., a personal name and a company like \"Wardi LLC\"), choose the company (\"Wardi LLC\"); otherwise use the person’s name.\n",
      "   - Do NOT infer the company from decorative/template headers or theme text (e.g., \"Green IT Company Professional Service Invoice\", \"Freelance Invoice Template\", brandy slogans) unless the brand appears within a labeled \"From\"/\"PAY TO\"/company block.\n",
      "   - If no explicit seller/company block can be identified via the labels above, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "5) TOTAL_AMOUNT\n",
      "   - The final amount payable (grand/final total).\n",
      "   - Accept explicit grand-total style labels (case-insensitive): \"TOTAL\", \"TOTAL:\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT DUE\", \"AMOUNT DUE\", \"BALANCE DUE\", \"Grand Total\", \"TOTAL DUE\".\n",
      "   - Selection rules and disambiguation:\n",
      "     - Ignore \"TOTAL AMOUNT\" or \"TOTAL\" when used as a table column header alongside headers like \"Quantity\", \"Unit Price\", \"Amount\", \"Description\". These are not the grand total.\n",
      "     - Prefer totals that appear in the end-of-invoice summary area directly adjacent to/after any subtotal/tax/discount lines (the itemized summary).\n",
      "     - If multiple grand-total-style labels exist:\n",
      "       - Prefer \"TOTAL DUE\"/\"AMOUNT DUE\"/\"BALANCE DUE\"/\"TOTAL AMOUNT DUE\" over a bare \"TOTAL\", unless the bare \"TOTAL\" is clearly the grand total immediately following the subtotal/tax/discount block.\n",
      "       - The amount should appear on the same line as the grand-total label; if not, take the nearest following non-empty amount line.\n",
      "       - Prefer totals positioned at or near the end of the document or summary area over isolated headings elsewhere.\n",
      "     - Do not choose an amount solely because it is the largest; rely on labels and placement.\n",
      "   - Normalize spacing between any currency symbol and digits if needed (e.g., \"$ 550\" -> \"$550\").\n",
      "\n",
      "6) BANK_NAME\n",
      "   - Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Bank Name\", or \"Bank\" when used as a label.\n",
      "   - Accept \"Bank Name: XYZ\" or a lone \"Bank\" line followed by the bank name on the next line.\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "7) ACCOUNT_NAME\n",
      "   - Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Account Name\", \"Account name\", \"A/C Name\", \"Account Holder Name\".\n",
      "   - The value may be on the same line or the next non-empty line.\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "8) ACCOUNT_NUMBER\n",
      "   - Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Account Number\", \"Account No\", \"Account No.\", \"Acct No\", \"Acct No.\", \"Account #\", \"Acct #\", \"A/C No\", \"A/C No.\", \"A/C Number\", \"A/C #\".\n",
      "   - Accept values on the same line or the nearest following non-empty line.\n",
      "   - Preserve dashes and spaces as they appear (e.g., \"0012-3456-7890\", \"0123 4567 8901\").\n",
      "   - Do NOT use \"Bank Account\" or plain \"Account\" as a substitute label unless it explicitly includes \"No\", \"Number\", or \"#\".\n",
      "   - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional guidance and edge cases:\n",
      "- When capturing multi-line blocks (BILLED_TO or PAY TO/FROM), stop at the next clear header/section label or a blank line to avoid bleeding into unrelated sections (e.g., \"Description\", \"Terms\", \"Bank Details\", \"Payment Method\", \"Authorized Signed\", \"Thank you\", \"Date\").\n",
      "- If both billed-to and from/company blocks share the same address/email, still keep them distinct: BILLED_TO is the customer/recipient; COMPANY is the issuer/seller.\n",
      "- Prefer explicit labels over inference; if no acceptable label is found for a field, output \"\" rather than guessing from a generic header.\n",
      "- Avoid using standalone brand words near \"INVOICE\" (e.g., \"INVOICEBorcelle\") as COMPANY unless they appear within a labeled \"From\"/\"PAY TO\"/company block.\n",
      "- Tie-breakers:\n",
      "  - For INVOICE_NUMBER, if both a generic \"No:\" value and an explicit \"Invoice No.\" value exist, use the explicit \"Invoice No.\" value.\n",
      "  - For INVOICE_DATE, allow \"Date:\" even if it appears on the same line as the billed-to block; treat it as invoice metadata and exclude it from BILLED_TO.\n",
      "  - For TOTAL_AMOUNT, if both a \"TOTAL\" adjacent to the item summary and a separate boxed \"TOTAL DUE\"/\"AMOUNT DUE\" amount appear elsewhere, prefer the clearly labeled \"TOTAL DUE\"/\"AMOUNT DUE\" unless the summary \"TOTAL\" is unmistakably the final total immediately following subtotal/tax/discount.\n",

      "           - Also accept a standalone number prefixed with \"#\" near the main INVOICE header.\n",
      "           - Capture the value on the same line or the next non-empty line.\n",
      "           - Strip a leading \"#\" from the captured value; preserve other punctuation/hyphens (e.g., \"INV-00008\", \"2000-15\", \"001\").\n",
      "           - If multiple candidates exist, prefer one explicitly labeled with \"Invoice ...\" over a generic \"No\". If still ambiguous, choose the one closest to the main invoice header.\n",
      "        \n",
      "        2) INVOICE_DATE\n",
      "           - Preferred labels (highest to lowest): \"Invoice Date\", \"Date of Issue\", \"Issue Date\", \"Date Issued\", \"Date\".\n",
      "           - If using the generic \"Date\", ensure it is not part of or inside the BILLED_TO/customer block; prefer a date located in the header/summary area associated with invoice metadata.\n",
      "           - Exclude non-issuing dates such as \"Service Date\", \"Due Date\", \"Payment Due\", \"Pay by\", \"Delivery Date\".\n",
      "           - When the label and value are on separate lines (e.g., \"DATE OF ISSUE\" followed by a date on the next line), capture the next non-empty line.\n",
      "           - Keep the format exactly as written (e.g., \"15/08/2028\", \"01 / 02 / 2023\", \"12.06.2024\").\n",
      "        \n",
      "        3) BILLED_TO\n",
      "           - This is the customer/recipient (not the sender).\n",

      "           - Capture that block’s lines until a clear section break: a blank line, or the start of another major section/label. Treat the following as breaks (case-insensitive): \"Description\", \"Item\", \"TOTAL\", \"TOTAL DUE\", \"SUBTOTAL\", \"SUB-TOTAL\", \"TAX\", \"TAX RATE\", \"DISCOUNT\", \"BANK\", \"Bank\", \"Bank Details\", \"TERMS\", \"NOTES\", \"PAY TO\", \"From\", \"Freelancer\", \"Company\", \"Invoice #\", \"Invoice No\", \"INVOICE NO\", \"Date\", \"Due Date\", \"Payment Method\", \"PAYMENT METHOD\", \"Authorized Signature\", \"Authorized Signed\", \"Pay by\".\n",

      "           - Preferred sources/labels (case-insensitive): \"From\", \"Company\", \"Seller\", \"Vendor\", \"Supplier\", \"Issuer\", \"PAY TO\", \"Pay To\", \"Freelancer\", \"Service Provider\".\n",
      "           - If a \"PAY TO\" block exists, extract the entity from there; if both a person and a company are listed (e.g., a personal name and a company like \"Wardi LLC\"), choose the company (\"Wardi LLC\"); otherwise use the person’s name.\n",
      "           - Do NOT infer the company from decorative/template headers or themes (e.g., \"Green IT Company Professional Service Invoice\", \"Freelance Invoice Template\", theme names).\n",

      "        \n",
      "        5) TOTAL_AMOUNT\n",
      "           - The final amount payable (grand/final total).\n",
      "           - Prefer explicit grand-total labels (case-insensitive): \"TOTAL\", \"TOTAL:\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT DUE\", \"AMOUNT DUE\", \"BALANCE DUE\", \"Grand Total\", \"TOTAL DUE\".\n",
      "           - Exclude \"SUBTOTAL\"/\"SUB-TOTAL\", \"TAX\", \"Tax Rate\", \"Discount\", per-line item totals, and intermediate totals.\n",
      "           - Selection rules when multiple candidates exist:\n",
      "             - The amount should appear on the same line as the grand-total label; if not, take the nearest following non-empty amount line.\n",
      "             - Prefer totals that appear in the end-of-invoice summary area directly adjacent to/after any subtotal/tax/discount lines (the itemized summary).\n",
      "             - If multiple grand-total-style labels exist (e.g., both \"TOTAL\" and \"TOTAL DUE\"), choose the one positioned with or immediately following the subtotal/tax/discount block rather than a standalone or decorative header elsewhere.\n",
      "             - If a \"TOTAL\" label has no adjacent amount and is immediately followed by unrelated headers/sections, fall back to the closest explicit grand-total-style label in the summary area (e.g., \"TOTAL AMOUNT\", \"AMOUNT DUE\"). Do not pick a number purely because it is largest.\n",
      "           - Normalize spacing between any currency symbol and digits if needed (e.g., \"$ 550\" -> \"$550\").\n",
      "        \n",
      "        6) BANK_NAME\n",
      "           - Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Bank Name\", or \"Bank\" when used as a label.\n",
      "           - Accept \"Bank Name: XYZ\" or a lone \"Bank\" line followed by the bank name on the next line.\n",
      "           - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "        \n",
      "        7) ACCOUNT_NAME\n",
      "           - Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Account Name\", \"Account name\", \"A/C Name\".\n",
      "           - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "        \n",
      "        8) ACCOUNT_NUMBER\n",
      "           - Value following labels (case-insensitive): \"Account Number\", \"Account No\", \"Account No.\", \"Acct No\", \"Acct No.\", \"Account #\", \"Acct #\", \"A/C No\", \"A/C No.\", \"A/C Number\", \"A/C #\".\n",
      "           - Preserve dashes and spaces as they appear (e.g., \"0012-3456-7890\", \"0123 4567 8901\").\n",
      "           - Do NOT use \"Bank Account\" or plain \"Account\" as a substitute label unless it explicitly includes \"No\", \"Number\", or \"#\".\n",
      "           - If absent, return \"\".\n",
      "        \n",
      "        Additional guidance and disambiguation:\n",
      "        - When capturing multi-line blocks (BILLED_TO or PAY TO/FROM), stop at the next clear header/section label or a blank line to avoid bleeding into unrelated sections (e.g., \"Description\", \"Terms\", \"Bank Details\", \"Payment Method\", \"Authorized Signed\", \"Thank you\", \"Date\").\n",
      "        - If both billed-to and from/company blocks share the same address/email, still keep them distinct: BILLED_TO is the customer/recipient; COMPANY is the issuer/seller.\n",
      "        - Prefer explicit labels over inference; if no acceptable label is found for a field, output \"\" rather than guessing from a generic header.\n",
      "        - Avoid using standalone brand words near \"INVOICE\" (e.g., \"INVOICEBorcelle\") as COMPANY unless they appear within a labeled \"From\"/\"PAY TO\"/company block.\n",
      "        - Tie-breakers:\n",
      "          - For INVOICE_NUMBER, if both a generic \"No:\" value and an explicit \"Invoice No.\" value exist, use the explicit \"Invoice No.\" value.\n",
      "          - For TOTAL_AMOUNT, if both \"TOTAL\" adjacent to the item summary and a separate large \"TOTAL DUE\" amount appear elsewhere, choose the amount that is with the itemized summary (subtotal/tax/discount context).\n",
