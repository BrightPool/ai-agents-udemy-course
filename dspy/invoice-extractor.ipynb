      "1. Only output keys from the schema above. Do not add other top-level keys. If some inferred/derived values are provided, indicate this only in a single NOTES string (see rule 6) — do not create new keys for inferred values.\n",
      "2. Prefer explicitly labeled values in the text. Use surrounding labels (\"BILL TO:\", \"PAY TO:\", \"BANK:\", \"Invoice Date:\", \"TOTAL\", \"SUBTOTAL\", \"TAX\", etc.) to assign values.\n",
      "3. Date normalization: attempt to parse common formats (DD/MM/YYYY, MM/DD/YYYY, \"16 June 2025\", etc.) and output YYYY-MM-DD if unambiguous. If ambiguous (e.g., 06/01/2023 could be June 1 or Jan 6) prefer the format consistent with other dates in document; if still ambiguous, return raw string.\n",
      "4. Currency: detect currency symbol or code. If only symbols appear and they are unambiguous (only \"$\"), set CURRENCY to \"USD\" when the document appears US/English and values use $; otherwise set CURRENCY to the currency symbol. If an ISO code (EUR, GBP, etc.) appears, use it.\n",
      "5. Totals: use numbers explicitly labeled \"SUBTOTAL\", \"TOTAL\", \"TOTAL AMOUNT DUE\", \"AMOUNT\", etc. Do not compute totals from line items unless the invoice does not contain any explicit subtotal/total and computing is necessary — in that exceptional case, compute only if all line item unit prices, quantities and line totals are present and consistent, and then set TOTAL and include a one-line NOTES (see rule 6) with the short explanation and the word \"INFERRED\". Otherwise, prefer leaving totals empty rather than guessing.\n",
      "6. NOTES: include a single top-level NOTES string only when some values were inferred or there are unresolved ambiguities to call out. Keep the note concise (1–2 short sentences), e.g., \"LINE_TOTAL for item 2 could not be matched; TAX inferred as 20% from label.\" If nothing to report, omit NOTES.\n",
      "7. When multiple values could map to the same schema field (e.g., two different \"Invoice No.\"), pick the value that is more explicitly labeled or appears nearer a header. Do not fabricate a combined field; if it remains unclear, omit the field and add a brief mention in NOTES.\n",
      "8. Output formatting: amounts may be returned as strings matching the invoice formatting (e.g., \"$1,900.00\"). For QTY return numbers (integers) when parseable.\n",
      "9. Email/phone detection: extract common patterns (emails: something@domain; phones: digits with separators, +country codes). Assign to the nearest party (BILL_TO or SELLER) based on proximity or labels; if proximity ambiguous, put into NOTES and/or include in SELLER if the invoice header appears to be from a company.\n",

      "  - Look for contiguous rows or lines that contain a text description and one or more numeric tokens (quantities, unit rates, totals).\n",
      "  - Recognize monetary amounts by currency symbols or common formats (e.g., $1,200.00, 1200.00, 1.200,00 depending on locale). Convert to a normalized \"1200.00\" format (remove thousands separators, ensure two decimals) for subtotal/tax/total and unit_price/amount fields.\n",
      "  - Recognize quantities as integer-like tokens (1, 2, 0.5, hours). If the invoice lists \"Hours\" or \"Qty\" headers, prefer those tokens as quantity.\n",
      "- If the invoice contains numeric values but mapping of which price/amount corresponds to which description is ambiguous, still produce one line item per visible description. For each such item:\n",

      "- If date strings are ambiguous (e.g., 03/04/2023 could be DD/MM or MM/DD) and the invoice contains a locale/clues (like a day name, month word, or other dates with year), use that to disambiguate. If you cannot decide, return the original string rather than forcing an ISO date.\n",

      "- If the document contains line items in multiple styles (some with quantity/unit price, others with rate/hours), accept mixed styles: represent each item with whichever fields apply.\n",
      "- If you cannot confidently split seller vs buyer, populate only buyer_name or seller_name if clear, and omit ambiguous contact fields.\n",

      "- Values should be strings unless specified otherwise (QUANTITY may be numeric or string if ambiguous).\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Strict extraction rules\n",
      "- Only include keys present in the input. If nothing in the input matches any canonical field, return {}.\n",
      "- Never invent or guess values. If uncertain, return the original substring exactly as it appears rather than a guessed normalization.\n",
      "- Trim leading/trailing whitespace on extracted values. Collapse multi-line addresses into a single string, separating lines with commas.\n",
      "- Do not output any other text besides the JSON object.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Date handling\n",
      "- If a date can be unambiguously parsed (examples: \"2024-03-06\", \"March 6, 2024\", \"06 March 2024\", \"15/08/2028\" where day-first is obvious), convert to ISO 8601 YYYY-MM-DD in the JSON value.\n",
      "- If the date is ambiguous (e.g., \"04/05/2023\"), prefer MM/DD/YYYY only if other context strongly indicates US locale (e.g., \"USA\", \"United States\", \"Anytown, USA\", or month names/US-style formatting elsewhere). If no locale cue, return the original date substring exactly.\n",
      "- Recognize common labels: \"Invoice Date\", \"Date of Issue\", \"DATE OF ISSUE\", \"Invoice\", \"INVOICE DATE\", etc. Map to DATE_OF_ISSUE. Recognize \"Service Date\", \"Work Date\", \"Date of Service\" → SERVICE_DATE. Recognize \"Due Date\", \"Payment Due\" → DUE_DATE.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Currency and amounts\n",
      "- Preserve the original currency symbol in monetary values (e.g., \"$2,100.00\").\n",
      "- Populate CURRENCY using ISO 4217 code if symbol/name is recognizable:\n",
      "  - \"$\" → \"USD\"\n",
      "  - \"€\" → \"EUR\"\n",
      "  - \"£\" → \"GBP\"\n",
      "  - \"¥\" → \"JPY\" (if clearly yen), \"C$\" → \"CAD\", \"A$\" → \"AUD\" when such prefixes appear.\n",
      "  - If only a symbol but ambiguous regionally and not in above list, you may map \"$\" to \"USD\". If unknown, set CURRENCY to the symbol present (e.g., \"₽\").\n",
      "- When you need to parse numeric values (e.g., to check totals), you may strip thousands separators (commas) and parse; however JSON output should keep the original formatting string exactly as extracted unless normalization is unambiguous and required (dates).\n",
      "- Recognize labels mapping to totals: \"Total\", \"Total Amount\", \"Invoice Total\" → TOTAL_AMOUNT; \"Amount Due\", \"Balance Due\", \"Total Amount Due\" → TOTAL_AMOUNT_DUE; \"Amount Paid\", \"Paid\" → AMOUNT_PAID; \"Subtotal\" → SUBTOTAL; \"Tax\", \"TAX RATE\" label and percent nearby → TAX_RATE; \"Tax Amount\" → TAX_AMOUNT.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Line item extraction heuristics\n",
      "- Group contiguous lines that represent the same item: description, quantity, unit price, and line total may appear on the same row or as successive nearby lines.\n",
      "- Typical column headers include DESCRIPTION, QTY/QTY., QUANTITY, UNIT PRICE, PRICE, AMOUNT, AMOUNT DUE, TOTAL; use these to align columns.\n",
      "- If numeric values and descriptions appear in separate lines but are adjacent, associate them in reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).\n",
      "- If mapping between descriptions and numeric values is ambiguous, still create LINE_ITEMS with best-effort pairing. For each item include RAW containing the original text snippet used. If a numeric field cannot be assigned confidently, set that field to null (or omit it) and note ambiguity in RAW. Maintain the original order of items as they appear.\n",
      "- If a quantity is expressed as \"30x\" or \"30 x\" keep the \"x\" if present in source; if numeric only, prefer a numeric string.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Seller / Buyer detection\n",
      "- Map common synonyms: \"Bill To\", \"Bill To:\" → BUYER_*; \"Customer\" → BUYER_*; \"From\", \"Seller\", \"Vendor\" → SELLER_*; \"Pay To\", \"Payable To\" → SELLER_*.\n",
      "- If multiple phone numbers/emails exist and are labeled (e.g., \"Phone (Seller):\", \"Bill To Phone:\"), place labeled numbers accordingly. If neither phone labeled, follow priority: topmost prominent phone → SELLER_PHONE, next phone → BUYER_PHONE.\n",
      "- Extract emails using standard patterns; preserve original formatting.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) Invoice number detection\n",
      "- Recognize labels: \"Invoice Number\", \"Invoice No.\", \"Invoice #\", \"INV-\", \"Invoice NO\", \"No.\", \"INVOICE NO.\", and standalone numbers immediately following those labels. Map to INVOICE_NUMBER. Include the entire substring (e.g., \"INV-00001\" or \"#12345\").\n",
      "\n",
      "8) Tax, discounts, and totals\n",
      "- TAX_RATE should be a percentage string if present, e.g., \"10%\".\n",
      "- TAX_AMOUNT should be the monetary amount labeled as tax.\n",
      "- Discounts: if labeled \"Discount\" without a canonical field in schema, do not add a new top-level key — you may include discount info only inside NOTES if you must capture it, but avoid adding keys outside schema.\n",
      "\n",
      "9) Bank and payment details\n",
      "- Recognize labels: \"Bank Name\", \"Bank:\", \"BANK NAME\", \"BANK\", \"Account Name\", \"Account Holder\", \"Account No\", \"Account Number\", \"Account No.\", \"Account #\" → map to BANK_NAME, ACCOUNT_NAME, ACCOUNT_NUMBER respectively.\n",
      "- PAYMENT_METHOD: if the invoice explicitly states a method (e.g., \"Payment Method: Bank transfer\", \"Pay by credit card\", \"Bank: <bank> Account No: <no>\"), put the raw payment text or a short normalized description.\n",
      "- If the \"PAY TO\" block contains a name and company, that maps to SELLER_NAME (or SELLER_NAME can be combined \"Person, Company\" if both present).\n",
      "\n",
      "10) Payment terms and notes\n",
      "- Extract \"Terms & Conditions\", \"Payment is due within X\", \"Net 30\", \"Payment due within 14 business days\", etc., into PAYMENT_TERMS (short) and NOTES (longer full text). Only include NOTES if there is non-trivial additional text (e.g., \"Thank you\", terms).\n",
      "- If PAYMENT_TERMS present, keep original phrasing unless a canonical short form is obvious (e.g., \"Payment is due within 30 days\" or \"Net 30\").\n",
      "\n",
      "11) Phones and emails\n",
      "- Extract typical phone formats and preserve original formatting, including \"+\" and dashes.\n",
      "- Extract emails exactly as they appear.\n",
      "\n",
      "12) Ambiguity and provenance\n",
      "- If a value is inferred (e.g., inferring US locale to interpret a date), prefer to return the original substring rather than a guessed normalized value. If you must include the inference rationale, put it only in NOTES — but remember the output must be only JSON.\n",
      "- For any ambiguous mapping of amounts to line items, create LINE_ITEMS with RAW showing the original lines used and set ambiguous fields to null; add a concise NOTES entry only if necessary to explain ambiguity.\n",
      "\n",
      "13) Ordering and priority rules\n",
      "- When multiple matches for a canonical field exist:\n",
      "  - For SELLER_* and BUYER_* prefer clearly labeled blocks. If no labels, use positional heuristics: topmost contact info → SELLER_*, next block below → BUYER_*.\n",
      "  - For phone numbers, follow the same topmost/next ordering.\n",
      "- For LINE_ITEMS preserve the appearance order.\n",
      "\n",
      "14) Text cleaning\n",
      "- Remove leading/trailing whitespace. Collapse internal multiple spaces into single spaces for extracted fields except where preserving original formatting matters (e.g., account numbers, phone numbers, monetary formatting).\n",
      "- Combine multi-line address blocks into one string separated by commas.\n",
      "\n",
      "15) Examples of labels to detect (non-exhaustive)\n",
      "- Invoice: \"Invoice Number\", \"Invoice No\", \"Invoice #\", \"INV-\"\n",
      "- Dates: \"Invoice Date\", \"Date of Issue\", \"Service Date\", \"Due Date\"\n",
      "- Parties: \"Bill To\", \"Customer\", \"BILL TO\", \"From\", \"From:\", \"Pay To\", \"PAY TO\"\n",
      "- Totals: \"Subtotal\", \"Tax\", \"Tax Rate\", \"Total\", \"Total Amount Due\", \"Amount due\", \"Balance due\", \"Amount Paid\"\n",
      "- Bank: \"Bank Name\", \"Bank:\", \"Account Name\", \"Account No\", \"Account Number\", \"Account #\"\n",
      "- Line items headers: \"Description\", \"Qty\", \"Quantity\", \"Unit Price\", \"Unit\", \"Price\", \"Amount\", \"Total\"\n",

      "- Do not invent values. If a canonical field is not present, do not create it.\n",

      "3. Amount fields should preserve the original currency symbol and formatting as strings (e.g., \"$1,250.00\"). Also set CURRENCY when possible by recognizing currency symbols or common words.\n",
      "4. For line items:\n",
      "   - Prefer explicit tabular structure. If the invoice shows a list of item names followed by a block of quantities and prices, attempt to map by row order.\n",
      "   - If a tabular mapping is ambiguous, extract the sequence of items and best-effort match qty/unit_price/line_total by order. Fill missing components with null.\n",

      "5. When multiple totals are present:\n",
      "   - Use TOTAL for the main \"Total\" label.\n",
      "   - Use TOTAL_DUE for labels \"Total Due\", \"Amount Due\", \"Balance Due\".\n",
      "   - Also fill SUBTOTAL, TAX, DISCOUNT, TAX_RATE where labeled.\n",
      "   - If a numeric value appears under \"Total\" and another distinct \"TOTAL DUE\" exists, include both.\n",

      "   - Emails: remove spaces and stray characters: \"h e llo@ex ample .com\" → \"hello@example.com\".\n",
      "   - Phones: strip excessive text but keep separators and + for country codes.\n",
      "   - Addresses: collapse multi-line address into a single-line string with commas separating logical parts.\n",
      "7. Bank details: accept labels like \"Bank Name\", \"Account Name\", \"Account Number\", \"IBAN\", \"SWIFT\", and map to BANK_NAME, BANK_ACCOUNT_NAME, BANK_ACCOUNT, IBAN, SWIFT. If a name appears under \"Bank Name\" but clearly looks like a person, still store as BANK_NAME (do not attempt to re-classify).\n",
      "8. If there are conflicting or duplicate fields (e.g., two different INVOICE_NUMBERs), choose the value that is clearly labeled \"Invoice No\", \"Invoice #\", \"No:\", or the one nearest the invoice header. Do not invent values.\n",
      "9. Heuristics & robustness:\n",
      "   - Be robust to templates, noise, repeated words, and spacing artifacts.\n",
      "   - Prefer explicit labels. When a label is missing but a pattern is clear (e.g., a line starting with \"$\" and a corresponding item line), extract by pattern.\n",
      "10. Output formatting:\n",
      "   - ITEMS must be an array (empty array [] if no items found).\n",
      "   - Monetary and numeric values should be strings as they appear unless conversion to number is clearly necessary for QTY or HOURS (then a number is acceptable).\n",

      "- Look for labels: \"Invoice No\", \"Invoice #\", \"Invoice number\", \"Invoice:\", \"Invoice no :\", \"No:\" etc.\n",
      "- Extract the closest token after the label; strip leading/trailing non-alphanumeric punctuation.\n",
      "- Accept numeric or alphanumeric IDs.\n",
      "- If no explicit label, look near the top/header area for a prominent stand-alone ID.\n",
      "\n",
      "Date (DATE)\n",
      "- Look for labels: \"Date\", \"Invoice Date\", \"Date :\", \"Invoice date:\".\n",
      "- Support formats: DD/MM/YYYY, D/M/YY, MM/DD/YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD, \"23 March 2025\", \"02 May 2021\", \"12/07/2023\", etc.\n",
      "- If the format is unambiguous, convert to ISO \"YYYY-MM-DD\".\n",
      "- If ambiguous (e.g., \"02/05/2021\") and no strong locale hint, return the original extracted date string.\n",
      "- You may use document locale clues (country names, address country, currency symbol) to disambiguate date formats, but only when that yields a clear, confident decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emails (EMAIL)\n",
      "- Extract text containing '@'. Normalize to lowercase and remove spaces and spurious characters inserted by OCR.\n",
      "- Accept only valid-looking email forms; if none confidently present, return null.\n",
      "- Do not place websites or other contacts here if they don't contain '@'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Phone numbers (BILL_TO_PHONE, PAY_TO_PHONE)\n",
      "- Remove incidental spaces, parentheses, dots; preserve leading '+' if present. You may remove hyphens.\n",
      "- Preferred normalized forms: compact starting with '+' if present (e.g., \"+1234567890\") or digits only if no '+'.\n",
      "- Remove textual noise like \"P :\", \"Phone :\", \"Tel:\" when extracting.\n",
      "- If multiple phones found for a block, choose the one nearest the name/address for that party.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bank and account fields (BANK_NAME, ACCOUNT_NAME, ACCOUNT_NUMBER, BSB)\n",
      "- Recognize labels: \"Bank\", \"Bank Name\", \"Account No\", \"Account Number\", \"Account :\", \"Account Name\", \"BSB\", \"Routing\", \"Sort Code\".\n",
      "- ACCOUNT_NUMBER must be digits only in the JSON (strip spaces, hyphens, letters). If after stripping non-digits no digits remain or parsing is uncertain, return null.\n",
      "- BSB/routing/sort codes: return as found (preserve letters/digits as present, but remove surrounding label text).\n",
      "- ACCOUNT_NAME should be the named account holder (vendor/pay-to) if present near bank lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monetary amounts and CURRENCY\n",
      "- Recognize currency symbols: $ -> USD, € -> EUR, £ -> GBP. If a currency code like \"AUD\", \"USD\", \"GBP\", \"EUR\" appears explicitly, prefer that.\n",
      "- If the same currency symbol is used consistently and unambiguously across amounts, set CURRENCY to the corresponding 3-letter ISO code. If multiple different symbols or ambiguous signals, set CURRENCY to null.\n",
      "- Monetary fields (TAX, SUBTOTAL, DISCOUNT, TOTAL, line RATE/AMOUNT) should preserve currency symbol and general formatting in the JSON output. It is acceptable to normalize thousand separators (e.g., \"$1,600.00\" -> \"$1600.00\" or \"$1600\") but not required; do not invent currency symbols.\n",

      "- Search for labeled tokens: \"Total\", \"TOTAL DUE\", \"Amount Due\", \"Total Amount Due\", \"Sub-Total\", \"Subtotal\", \"Tax\", \"VAT\", \"GST\", \"Discount\".\n",
      "- For TAX_RATE or DISCOUNT_RATE look for percentages near labels (e.g., \"Tax (10%)\", \"VAT 15%\"); set RATE fields like \"10%\".\n",
      "- For TAX or DISCOUNT monetary values, prefer the explicitly labeled monetary amount adjacent to the label.\n",
      "- Selection priority for TOTAL: explicitly labeled totals first; if none labeled, use the largest monetary amount (unless a larger amount is clearly labeled Subtotal).\n",
      "\n",
      "PAYMENT_TERMS, TERMS, NOTES\n",
      "- PAYMENT_TERMS: concise payment instruction often near \"Payment Terms\", \"Payment is due\", \"Terms\". Extract a short payment instruction (e.g., \"Payment is due within 30 days.\").\n",
      "- TERMS: longer terms & conditions blocks often labeled \"Terms & Conditions\" or \"Terms\". If no separate long block exists, TERMS may equal PAYMENT_TERMS.\n",
      "- NOTES: any remaining short free-form notes, thank-you lines, website/extra contacts or non-classified instructions. Avoid duplicating content between NOTES and other fields unless clearly separate.\n",

      "GENERAL PARSING PRINCIPLES\n",
      "- Prefer explicitly labelled values first. When multiple candidates exist prefer:\n",
      "  1) explicit label (e.g., immediately after \"Invoice No\", \"Invoice #\", \"Invoice number\", \"No:\", \"Invoice :\")\n",
      "  2) nearby unlabeled value (near a known heading or header region)\n",
      "  3) largest matching token (for totals/amounts)\n",
      "- If multiple invoices appear, extract fields for the first invoice only.\n",
      "- Do NOT invent or guess values. If uncertain, return null.\n",
      "- Normalize and repair common OCR corruption: coalesce tokens split by spaces (e.g., \"real l ygreat s i te\" -> \"reallygreatsite\"), remove repeated punctuation noise, join number fragments split by spaces/hyphens (e.g., \"0012-3456-7890\" -> \"001234567890\" for internal parsing), and remove spurious whitespace inside emails/phones/account numbers.\n",
      "- Rejoin lines that clearly belong together (e.g., multi-line addresses or a description wrapped to next line).\n",
      "- Conservatively parse: return parsed ISO dates only if unambiguous; return numeric QTY/HOURS only if confidently parsed; otherwise null.\n",
      "\n",
      "SPECIFIC FIELD EXTRACTION RULES\n",
      "\n",
      "Invoice number (INVOICE_NO)\n",
      "- Look for labels: \"Invoice No\", \"Invoice #\", \"Invoice number\", \"Invoice :\", \"No:\" etc.\n",
      "- Extract the nearest token after such a label; strip leading non-alphanumeric punctuation. Accept alphanumeric IDs.\n",
      "- If none found, search header region for a prominent short token that looks like an invoice identifier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Date (DATE)\n",
      "- Look for labels \"Date\", \"Invoice Date\", \"Date :\" etc.\n",
      "- Support common formats: DD/MM/YYYY, D/M/YY, MM/DD/YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD, \"23 March 2025\", \"02 May 2021\", \"12/07/2023\", \"15 December, 2026\", etc.\n",
      "- If the format is unambiguous, convert to ISO \"YYYY-MM-DD\".\n",
      "- If ambiguous (e.g., \"02/05/2021\" and no locale context), return the original extracted date string exactly as found (after cleaning OCR artifacts).\n",
      "- If multiple dates present, prefer the one labeled \"Invoice Date\" or closest to the invoice header.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emails (EMAIL)\n",
      "- Extract any token containing '@'. Normalize to lowercase and remove OCR-inserted spaces/characters (e.g., \"hel lo@real lygreats i te .com\" -> \"hello@reallygreatsite.com\").\n",
      "- Only populate EMAIL; do not put websites or other contacts here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Phone numbers (BILL_TO_PHONE, PAY_TO_PHONE)\n",
      "- Look for labels \"Phone\", \"Tel\", \"T:\", \"P:\" near bill/pay blocks.\n",
      "- Remove incidental spaces, parentheses, dots; preserve leading '+' if present. Accept hyphens or remove them. Preferred normalized form: compact starting with '+' if country code present (e.g., \"+1234567890\") or digits only if no '+' (e.g., \"0123456789\").\n",
      "- Remove surrounding text like \"Phone :\" or \"P :\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Bank and account fields (BANK_NAME, ACCOUNT_NAME, ACCOUNT_NUMBER, BSB)\n",
      "- Recognize labels: \"Bank\", \"Bank Name\", \"Bank:\", \"Account No\", \"Account Number\", \"Account :\", \"Account name\", \"Account name:\", \"BSB\", \"Routing\", \"Sort code\".\n",
      "- ACCOUNT_NUMBER in JSON must contain digits only. Strip spaces, hyphens, letters, but if after stripping no digits or ambiguous formatting, return null.\n",
      "- BSB or routing codes: return as found (trim whitespace and surrounding labels).\n",
      "- ACCOUNT_NAME preserve capitalization/spelling as found (after cleaning OCR noise).\n",
      "\n",
      "Monetary amounts and CURRENCY\n",
      "- Recognize currency symbols: \"$\" -> USD, \"€\" -> EUR, \"£\" -> GBP, \"₹\" or common OCR variations like \"â‚¹\" -> INR. If the same symbol is used consistently and unambiguously, set CURRENCY to that ISO code. If multiple different symbols or ambiguous, set CURRENCY to null.\n",
      "- Monetary fields (TAX, SUBTOTAL, DISCOUNT, TOTAL, RATE/AMOUNT) should preserve the currency symbol/text as found in the invoice string in the output. It is acceptable to remove thousands separators for normalization (e.g., \"$1,235.00\" -> \"$1235.00\") but not required; do not invent currency symbols.\n",
      "- When scanning amounts, collect currency-like tokens (symbols followed by numbers or numbers followed by currency codes) and map labeled amounts to fields preferentially.\n",
      "\n",
      "Selection priority for totals (SUBTOTAL / TOTAL / TAX)\n",
      "- Prefer explicitly labeled values: \"Total\", \"TOTAL DUE\", \"Amount Due\", \"Total Amount Due\", \"Subtotal\", \"Sub-Total\", \"Tax\", \"GST\", \"VAT\".\n",
      "- If no labeled total, the largest monetary value is likely TOTAL unless a larger value is explicitly labeled \"Sub-Total\" or \"Subtotal\".\n",
      "- TAX_RATE: look for labels \"Tax (10%)\", \"GST 10%\", \"VAT 20%\" etc. Extract percentage string (e.g., \"10%\") and adjacent monetary TAX value when present.\n",
      "\n",
      "Discounts (DISCOUNT_RATE, DISCOUNT)\n",
      "- Detect \"Discount\" with possible rate (e.g., \"Discount (30%)\" or \"30% Discount\"). Extract percentage and monetary discount amount if present.\n",
      "\n",
      "PAYMENT_TERMS, TERMS, NOTES\n",
      "- PAYMENT_TERMS: short payment instruction sentences near \"Payment Terms\", \"Terms\", \"Please pay\", \"Payment is due within X days\", etc. Prefer concise sentence(s) describing how/when to pay (e.g., \"Payment is due within 30 days.\").\n",
      "- TERMS: longer terms & conditions blocks if present (can be same as PAYMENT_TERMS if no separate block).\n",
      "- NOTES: any remaining short free-form notes, thank-you lines, or additional instructions not categorized elsewhere (e.g., website, extra contact, invoice references). Combine multiple short note tokens with semicolons if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "ITEMS detection and parsing (must be an array)\n",
      "- Items are lines or grouped lines where a description is followed by numeric columns. Heuristics:\n",
      "  - Lines containing two or more currency-like tokens or numeric amounts are likely item lines.\n",
      "  - Look for headers like \"DESCRIPTION\", \"QTY\", \"Quantity\", \"HRS\", \"HOURS\", \"UNIT PRICE\", \"PRICE\", \"RATE\", \"AMOUNT\", \"TOTAL\" to map columns.\n",
      "  - Common patterns: DESCRIPTION [QTY] [UNIT PRICE] [AMOUNT] OR DESCRIPTION [HOURS] [RATE] [AMOUNT].\n",
      "- For hours vs quantity:\n",
      "  - If a column header or unit contains \"hr\", \"hrs\", \"hour\", set HOURS (numeric). HOURS can be integer or float.\n",
      "  - If quantity is an integer count, set QTY (integer).\n",
      "  - If invoice shows both QTY and HOURS, populate both when clearly present.\n",
      "- Parse numeric QTY/HOURS to numbers. QTY should be integer when possible. HOURS can be float. If parsing fails or ambiguous, set QTY/HOURS to null.\n",
      "- RATE and AMOUNT must be strings as found (preserve currency symbol if present).\n",
      "- DESCRIPTION should be the textual description cleaned of OCR artifacts and not include numeric columns. If a single item description spans multiple lines, join adjacent lines reasonably.\n",
      "- If no items are found, ITEMS must be [].\n",
      "\n",
      "NORMALIZATION, OCR FIXES, AND EDGE CASES\n",
      "- Merge split tokens and remove spurious spaces inside tokens (e.g., \"re al l y\" -> \"really\").\n",
      "- Coalesce fragmented emails/phones/bank numbers split across whitespace or punctuation.\n",
      "- Repair common OCR character misreads where obvious (e.g., \"â‚¹\" -> \"₹\"); map to currency ISO if confident.\n",
      "- If a data piece could belong to either PAY_TO or BILL_TO and is ambiguous, prefer:\n",
      "  - PAY_TO for seller/vendor fields (bank, account, vendor name/address)\n",
      "  - BILL_TO for customer fields (customer name, customer address)\n",
      "  - If still ambiguous, use proximity to nearest heading or top-of-document for PAY_TO (vendor) and lower blocks for BILL_TO (customer).\n",
      "- If multiple candidates labeled the same exist, take the one nearest the invoice header or nearest the primary invoice label.\n",
      "- When uncertain about currency detection, set CURRENCY to null rather than guessing.\n",
      "- Never return empty strings for top-level fields — use null.\n",
      "\n",
      "IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY (recommended step sequence)\n",
      "1. Normalize raw text: collapse multi-spaces, fix obvious OCR splits, unify common mis-encoded characters, remove repeated punctuation, join broken numeric tokens.\n",
      "2. Identify header region (top several lines) to find PAY_TO/vendor and invoice number/date.\n",
      "3. Find labeled fields first (Invoice No, Date, Total, Subtotal, Tax, Bank, Account); use proximity for unlabeled candidates.\n",
      "4. Gather currency-like tokens and candidate amounts; map labeled amounts to SUBTOTAL/TAX/TOTAL preferentially.\n",
      "5. Detect items by scanning for repeated patterns/rows with numeric tokens; map columns using headers if present.\n",
      "6. Parse and normalize values conservatively according to the rules above.\n",
      "\n",
      "ADDITIONAL NOTES\n",
      "- Do not output any keys other than the exact top-level keys specified above.\n",
      "- Ensure the JSON contains all listed keys. Use null where not found; ITEMS must be an array.\n",
      "- Return monetary fields, bank names, account names, emails, addresses, and other text fields as strings preserving reasonable original formatting (but cleaned of OCR artifacts).\n",
      "- For ACCOUNT_NUMBER: return digits-only string or null.\n",
      "- For PHONE fields: return compact normalized string (preserving leading '+' if present) or null.\n",

      "   - If ambiguous (e.g., \"04/05/2023\" and locale is not clear), do NOT guess: return the original substring exactly as found.\n",
      "   - Recognize common separators and formats (/, -, ., spaces, month names, ordinal suffixes).\n",
      "2. Prefer parsed ISO only when the parsing is unambiguous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currency and amount rules\n",
      "1. Preserve the currency symbol in amount strings (e.g., \"$2,100.00\" remains \"$2,100.00\").\n",
      "2. Populate CURRENCY with an ISO 4217 code when the currency symbol or explicit name is recognizable:\n",

      "   If symbol is ambiguous and no explicit currency name is present, you may set CURRENCY to the raw symbol (e.g., \"$\").\n",
      "3. When parsing numeric values internally (for decisions), remove thousands separators (commas, spaces) but do not change the original extracted strings in output.\n",
      "4. Choose totals based on explicit labels: \"Total\", \"Total amount\", \"Invoice Total\", \"Amount Due\", \"Balance\". If multiple totals appear, prefer the value clearly labeled \"Total\" or \"Total amount\". For \"Amount due\" or \"Balance\", map to TOTAL_AMOUNT_DUE.\n",
      "\n",
      "Line item extraction (LINE_ITEMS)\n",
      "1. Detect logical line items where a description and related numeric values appear together in a row or in clear columns. Create one object per logical item, preserving the order they appear in the text.\n",
      "2. Recognize common patterns: DESCRIPTION [QUANTITY] [UNIT_PRICE] [LINE_TOTAL] and variations (HOURS/PRICE/TOTAL, QTY/UNIT/AMOUNT).\n",
      "3. Pair description tokens with numeric tokens by proximity and column alignment. If clear columned layout exists, use column mapping; if layout is messy, use nearest numeric tokens to the right of the description.\n",
      "4. If any field for an item is ambiguous or cannot be determined, set that field to null or omit it, and put the original snippet used for that item into RAW. RAW should contain the original line or the smallest contiguous snippet used to create that line item. If mapping is impossible, include a RAW that notes the ambiguity (e.g., \"RAW\": \"Could not map amounts to descriptions\").\n",

      "Bank and payment details\n",

      "1. Collapse multi-line addresses into a single string with components separated by commas (e.g., multiple lines → \"line1, line2, city, state postal\").\n",
      "2. Remove extra whitespace, but preserve punctuation and separators needed to retain meaning.\n",
      "3. Keep original ordering: SELLER_* should come from \"From\", header/topmost contact area, or vendor-labeled sections; BUYER_* should come from \"Bill To\", \"Invoice to\", \"BILL TO\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Mapping synonyms\n",
      "1. Map common synonyms to canonical keys:\n",

      "   - \"Invoice NO.\", \"Invoice #\" → INVOICE_NUMBER\n",
      "2. When labels are present, prefer labeled values even if other similar values exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ambiguity, inference, and missing data\n",
      "1. Never invent values. If a canonical field is not present or cannot be reliably extracted, omit that key from the output.\n",
      "2. If a value is ambiguous or you must infer it, prefer returning the original substring as found rather than a guessed normalized value.\n",

      "5. Trim leading and trailing whitespace for all extracted strings.\n",
      "6. Only include a key when a corresponding value is actually present in the input. Do NOT include keys with empty strings to “fill” the schema.\n",
      "7. Preserve the order of LINE_ITEMS as they appear in the input.\n",
      "\n",
      "DATE HANDLING and NORMALIZATION\n",
      "1. For DATE_OF_ISSUE, SERVICE_DATE, and DUE_DATE:\n",
      "   - If a date is unambiguous (examples: \"2024-03-06\", \"March 6, 2024\", \"06 March 2024\", \"15/08/2028\" where day>12 or explicit day-month order), convert it to ISO 8601 YYYY-MM-DD.\n",
      "   - If ambiguous (e.g., \"04/05/2023\" with unknown locale), DO NOT guess: return the original substring exactly as found.\n",
      "   - Recognize common separators and formats (/, -, ., spaces, month names, ordinal suffixes).\n",
      "2. Prefer ISO only when parsing is unambiguous.\n",
      "\n",
      "CURRENCY and AMOUNT RULES\n",
      "1. Preserve the original currency symbol in amount strings (e.g., \"$2,100.00\" remains \"$2,100.00\").\n",
      "2. Populate CURRENCY with an ISO 4217 code when the currency symbol or explicit currency name is recognizable:\n",
      "   - $ → USD (do not convert based on locale unless an explicit currency name appears)\n",
      "   - € → EUR\n",
      "   - £ → GBP\n",
      "   - ¥ → JPY\n",
      "   - If a currency name appears explicitly (AUD, CAD, SGD, etc.), use that code.\n",
      "   - If symbol is ambiguous and no explicit name is present, you may set CURRENCY to the raw symbol (e.g., \"$\").\n",
      "3. Internally, when parsing numeric values for decisions, remove thousands separators (commas, spaces). Do not change the original extracted strings in output.\n",
      "4. Choose totals based on explicit labels in this priority:\n",
      "   - TOTAL_AMOUNT: labeled \"Total\", \"Total amount\", \"Invoice Total\", \"Invoice total\", \"Invoice Total:\"\n",
      "   - TOTAL_AMOUNT_DUE: labeled \"Amount due\", \"Amount Due\", \"Balance\", \"Balance Due\", \"Total Amount Due\"\n",
      "   - SUBTOTAL: labeled \"Subtotal\", \"SUB-TOTAL\", \"SUBTOTAL\", \"Sub Total\"\n",
      "   If multiple totals appear, prefer the one clearly labeled \"Total\" or \"Total amount\" for TOTAL_AMOUNT; use labeled \"Amount due\"/\"Balance\" for TOTAL_AMOUNT_DUE.\n",
      "\n",
      "LINE ITEMS (LINE_ITEMS)\n",
      "1. Detect logical line items where a description and related numeric values appear together (same line or in clear columns). Create one object per logical item in original order.\n",
      "2. Recognize patterns: DESCRIPTION [QUANTITY] [UNIT_PRICE] [LINE_TOTAL] and variations such as HOURS/PRICE/TOTAL, QTY/UNIT/AMOUNT.\n",
      "3. If text is tabular (consistent column positions), infer columns by token index across multiple lines.\n",
      "4. If layout is messy, pair description tokens with numeric tokens by proximity and by aligning numeric columns if present. Prefer numeric tokens to the right of the description.\n",
      "5. QUANTITY: return as a number if the quantity token is unambiguous (e.g., \"1\", \"10\", \"3\"). If it contains nonnumeric chars (e.g., \"1x\"), return as string.\n",
      "6. RAW: For each line item include RAW when any ambiguity exists or when numeric parts were taken from different tokens. RAW should be the original line or the smallest contiguous snippet used to construct that item. If mapping is impossible, RAW should reflect that (e.g., \"Could not map amounts to descriptions\").\n",
      "7. Do not invent quantities/prices. If a missing line total can be unambiguously computed from qty × unit price, you may compute it; otherwise omit and include RAW to show ambiguity.\n",
      "\n",
      "PHONE NUMBERS and EMAILS\n",
      "1. Extract common phone formats and preserve original formatting: digits with spaces, dashes, parentheses, plus signs. Typical patterns: \"+1 (555) 555-5555\", \"(555) 555-5555\", \"555-555-5555\", \"0123 4567 8901\".\n",
      "2. Extract emails by standard pattern local@domain and preserve original.\n",
      "3. If multiple phone numbers exist and labels identify SELLER vs BUYER, assign accordingly. If unlabeled, place the most prominent/topmost phone under SELLER_PHONE and the next under BUYER_PHONE.\n",
      "\n",
      "INVOICE NUMBER DETECTION\n",
      "1. Recognize labels: \"Invoice Number\", \"Invoice No.\", \"Invoice #\", \"Invoice NO.\", \"INV-\", \"No.\", \"Invoice\" near a number. Extract the invoice identifier string exactly as found (trimmed) — do not alter format.\n",
      "\n",
      "BANK & PAYMENT DETAILS\n",
      "1. Extract BANK_NAME, ACCOUNT_NAME (account holder), and ACCOUNT_NUMBER when present. Recognize labels such as \"Bank name:\", \"BANK DETAILS\", \"Account No:\", \"Account number:\", \"Account Name:\", \"Account:\", \"Account holder\".\n",
      "2. PAYMENT_METHOD: extract explicit payment method text when present (\"Bank transfer\", \"Credit card\", \"PayPal\"); if only bank details are present, you may synthesize a PAYMENT_METHOD value that contains the raw payment instruction text (e.g., \"Borcelle Bank; Account name: Olivia Wilson; Account number: 0123 4567 8901\").\n",
      "3. PAYMENT_TERMS: extract text like \"Net 30\", \"Payment is due within 30 days\", \"Due on receipt\", \"Payment is due within 14 business days.\" Preserve wording.\n",
      "\n",
      "ADDRESS HANDLING and CLEANING\n",
      "1. Collapse multi-line addresses into a single string with components separated by commas (e.g., \"line1, line2, city, state postal\").\n",
      "2. Remove extra whitespace while preserving punctuation and separators needed to retain meaning.\n",
      "3. SELLER_* should be taken from a \"From\", vendor, supplier, or header/topmost contact block. BUYER_* should come from \"Bill To\", \"Bill To:\", \"To:\", \"Invoice to\", \"BILL TO\", or a \"Customer:\"/\"Client:\" block.\n",
      "\n",
      "MAPPING SYNONYMS & LABELS\n",
      "1. Map these common synonyms:\n",
      "   - \"Bill To\", \"Bill To:\" → BUYER_NAME, BUYER_ADDRESS, etc.\n",
      "   - \"From\", \"Supplier\", \"Vendor\" → SELLER_NAME, SELLER_ADDRESS, etc.\n",
      "   - \"Amount due\", \"Balance\", \"Balance due\" → TOTAL_AMOUNT_DUE\n",
      "   - \"Total\", \"Total amount\", \"Invoice total\" → TOTAL_AMOUNT\n",
      "   - \"Invoice NO.\", \"Invoice #\", \"Invoice Number\" → INVOICE_NUMBER\n",
      "2. When labels are present, prefer labeled values even if other similar unlabeled values exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "TAX, SUBTOTAL, AND AMOUNTS\n",
      "1. Extract SUBTOTAL, TAX_RATE (e.g., \"10%\"), TAX_AMOUNT, TOTAL_AMOUNT, TOTAL_AMOUNT_DUE, and AMOUNT_PAID when explicitly present and labeled. Preserve currency symbols in strings.\n",
      "2. TAX_RATE should be returned exactly as found (e.g., \"10%\").\n",
      "\n",
      "NOTES and MISCELLANEOUS\n",
      "1. Extract visible notes, terms, or thank-you messages into NOTES (e.g., \"Thank you for your business!\", \"Terms & Conditions\", payment notes). Preserve original text; trim whitespace.\n",
      "2. If payment instructions or terms are present in the document header/footer, include them appropriately in PAYMENT_METHOD, PAYMENT_TERMS, BANK_* or NOTES as fits the label.\n",
      "\n",
      "AMBIGUITY, INFERENCE & MISSING DATA\n",
      "1. Never invent values. If a canonical field is not present or cannot be reliably extracted, omit that key from the output.\n",
      "2. If a value is ambiguous or must be inferred, prefer returning the original substring rather than a guessed normalized value.\n",
      "3. If multiple candidates exist for a field and none are clearly labeled, choose the most prominent/topmost occurrence.\n",
      "4. If nothing in the input text matches any canonical field, return {}.\n",

      "6. Preserve LINE_ITEMS order as they appear in the input.\n",
      "\n",
      "DATE HANDLING and NORMALIZATION\n",
      "1. For DATE_OF_ISSUE, SERVICE_DATE, and DUE_DATE:\n",
      "   - If the date is unambiguous, convert to ISO 8601 YYYY-MM-DD. Unambiguous examples: \"2024-03-06\", \"March 6, 2024\", \"06 March 2024\", \"15/08/2028\" (day>12 or explicit day-month order), \"6th March 2024\", \"06.03.2024\" where format is clearly day-month or month-name present.\n",
      "   - If ambiguous (e.g., \"04/05/2023\" without other locale clues), DO NOT guess: return the original substring exactly as found.\n",
      "   - Recognize common separators and month names; strip ordinal suffixes when interpreting but preserve original substring if ambiguous.\n",
      "2. Prefer ISO only when parsing is unambiguous.\n",
      "\n",
      "CURRENCY and AMOUNTS\n",
      "1. Preserve original currency formatting for amounts (e.g., \"$2,100.00\" remains \"$2,100.00\").\n",
      "2. Populate CURRENCY with an ISO 4217 code when recognizable:\n",
      "   - $ → USD (do not attempt locale-disambiguation)\n",
      "   - € → EUR\n",
      "   - £ → GBP\n",
      "   - ¥ → JPY\n",
      "   - If an explicit currency name/code appears (AUD, CAD, SGD, USD, EUR, GBP, etc.), use that code.\n",
      "   - If the symbol is ambiguous and no explicit name is present, you may set CURRENCY to the raw symbol (e.g., \"$\").\n",
      "3. When parsing numbers internally (for alignment/decisions), remove thousands separators (commas, spaces). Do not change the original extracted strings in output.\n",
      "\n",
      "AMOUNTS PRIORITY RULES\n",
      "1. Map totals by label priority:\n",
      "   - TOTAL_AMOUNT: prefer values labeled \"Total\", \"Total amount\", \"Invoice Total\", \"Invoice total\", \"Invoice Total:\" (case-insensitive).\n",
      "   - TOTAL_AMOUNT_DUE: prefer \"Amount due\", \"Amount Due\", \"Balance\", \"Balance Due\", \"Total Amount Due\".\n",
      "   - SUBTOTAL: prefer \"Subtotal\", \"SUB-TOTAL\", \"SUBTOTAL\", \"Sub Total\".\n",
      "2. TAX_RATE should be returned exactly as found (e.g., \"10%\").\n",
      "3. TAX_AMOUNT, AMOUNT_PAID, and SUBTOTAL must be taken from explicitly labeled items when available.\n",
      "\n",
      "INVOICE NUMBER DETECTION\n",
      "1. Recognize labels: \"Invoice Number\", \"Invoice No.\", \"Invoice #\", \"Invoice NO.\", \"INV-\", \"No.\", \"Invoice\" near a number. Extract the invoice identifier string exactly as found (trimmed, do not reformat).\n",
      "\n",
      "PHONE and EMAIL\n",
      "1. Extract phone by common patterns and preserve formatting: e.g., \"+1 (555) 555-5555\", \"(555) 555-5555\", \"555-555-5555\", \"0123 4567 8901\".\n",
      "2. Extract emails by standard pattern local@domain.\n",
      "3. Assign phone numbers/emails to SELLER_* from topmost header or any \"From\", \"Supplier\", \"Vendor\" block. Assign to BUYER_* from \"Bill To\", \"Bill To:\", \"To:\", \"Invoice to\", \"BILL TO\", \"Customer:\", \"Client:\" blocks.\n",
      "4. If unlabeled and multiple phones: put the most prominent/topmost phone under SELLER_PHONE and the next under BUYER_PHONE.\n",
      "\n",
      "ADDRESSES\n",
      "1. Collapse multi-line addresses into one string with components separated by commas. Remove extra whitespace but preserve punctuation and separators needed for meaning.\n",
      "2. SELLER_* should come from \"From\", vendor, supplier, or header/topmost contact block. BUYER_* should come from billing/customer blocks as described above.\n",
      "\n",
      "LINE ITEMS (LINE_ITEMS)\n",
      "1. Detect logical line items where a description and related numeric values appear together (same line or clear columns). Create one object per logical item in original order.\n",
      "2. Recognize patterns: DESCRIPTION [QUANTITY] [UNIT_PRICE] [LINE_TOTAL], HOURS/PRICE/TOTAL, QTY/UNIT/AMOUNT, and similar.\n",
      "3. If the input is tabular and columns are consistent across lines, infer columns by token index; align numeric columns to the right of descriptions.\n",
      "4. If layout is messy, pair description tokens with numeric tokens by proximity and by aligning numeric columns across multiple lines. Prefer numeric tokens to the RIGHT of the description.\n",
      "5. QUANTITY: return as a number if the token is purely numeric (e.g., \"1\", \"10\", \"3\"). If it contains non-numeric characters (e.g., \"30x\", \"1.5h\"), return as a string.\n",
      "6. RAW: include RAW for a line item when any ambiguity exists or when numeric parts were taken from different tokens. RAW must be the original line or the smallest contiguous snippet used to construct that item. If mapping is impossible, RAW should be \"Could not map amounts to descriptions\".\n",
      "7. Do not invent quantities or prices. If a missing line total can be unambiguously computed from qty × unit price (both present and numeric), you may compute it and include it as LINE_TOTAL (formatted using original unit/qty currency formatting where reasonable); otherwise omit and include RAW.\n",
      "8. LINE_ITEM objects should include only DESCRIPTION, QUANTITY, UNIT_PRICE, LINE_TOTAL, RAW — omit any of those keys that are not present.\n",
      "\n",
      "BANK & PAYMENT DETAILS\n",
      "1. Extract BANK_NAME, ACCOUNT_NAME, and ACCOUNT_NUMBER when present. Recognize labels: \"Bank name:\", \"BANK DETAILS\", \"Bank:\", \"Account No:\", \"Account number:\", \"Account Name:\", \"Account:\", \"Account holder\", \"Account name\".\n",
      "2. PAYMENT_METHOD: extract explicit payment method text when present (\"Bank transfer\", \"Credit card\", \"PayPal\"). If only bank details exist, you may synthesize a PAYMENT_METHOD value that contains the raw payment instruction text (e.g., \"Bank: X; Account name: Y; Account number: Z\").\n",
      "3. PAYMENT_TERMS: extract phrases like \"Net 30\", \"Due on receipt\", \"Payment is due within 30 days\", preserving original wording.\n",
      "\n",
      "MAPPING SYNONYMS & LABELS\n",
      "1. Map these synonyms (case-insensitive) to canonical fields:\n",
      "   - \"Bill To\", \"Bill To:\" → BUYER_NAME / BUYER_ADDRESS / BUYER_PHONE / BUYER_EMAIL\n",
      "   - \"From\", \"Supplier\", \"Vendor\" → SELLER_NAME / SELLER_ADDRESS / SELLER_PHONE / SELLER_EMAIL\n",
      "   - \"Amount due\", \"Balance\" → TOTAL_AMOUNT_DUE\n",
      "   - \"Total\", \"Total amount\", \"Invoice total\" → TOTAL_AMOUNT\n",
      "   - \"Invoice NO.\", \"Invoice #\", \"Invoice Number\" → INVOICE_NUMBER\n",
      "2. When labels are present, prefer labeled values even if other similar unlabeled values exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "NOTES and MISC\n",
      "1. Extract visible notes, terms, or thank-you messages into NOTES if present. Preserve original text and trim whitespace.\n",
      "2. If payment instructions or terms are in the header/footer, include them appropriately in PAYMENT_METHOD, PAYMENT_TERMS, BANK_*, or NOTES depending on the label.\n",
      "\n",
      "PRIORITIZATION and AMBIGUITY\n",
      "1. Prefer labeled values. If multiple candidates exist and none are clearly labeled, choose the most prominent/topmost occurrence.\n",
      "2. Never invent values. If a field is not present or cannot be reliably extracted, omit it.\n",
      "3. If a value is ambiguous or must be inferred, return the original substring rather than guessing.\n",
      "4. If nothing in the input text matches any canonical field, return {}.\n",

      "   - Only include the *_NUM fields if parsing to numeric is unambiguous.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Normalization rules\n",
      "   - Dates: Prefer ISO format \"YYYY-MM-DD\". If original format is unambiguous (e.g., \"2023-01-05\", \"05 Jan 2023\", \"Jan 5, 2023\"), convert to ISO. If ambiguous numeric formats exist (e.g., \"01/02/2023\"), use these heuristics:\n",
      "       a) If there is explicit label \"Invoice Date\" or \"Date of Issue\", map to DATE_OF_ISSUE and convert using locale clues (if address/country = USA, treat as MM/DD/YYYY; if not or unknown, treat as DD/MM/YYYY if day>12). If still ambiguous, keep original string instead of guessing.\n",
      "   - Money: Preserve currency symbol/format in string fields (UNIT_PRICE, AMOUNT). When creating numeric versions (UNIT_PRICE_NUM, AMOUNT_NUM, SUBTOTAL numeric), remove currency symbols, remove thousand separators (commas), and use dot as decimal separator. Example: \"$2,000.00\" -> 2000.00\n",
      "   - Currency: If currency symbol present, set CURRENCY to an ISO code when obvious (e.g., \"$\" + US address -> \"USD\"; \"£\" -> \"GBP\"; \"€\" -> \"EUR\"). If not obvious, you may omit CURRENCY.\n",
      "   - Totals: SUBTOTAL, TAX_AMOUNT, DISCOUNT_AMOUNT, TOTAL_AMOUNT, BALANCE_DUE should include currency symbol in the string form if present in source.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Mapping and heuristics\n",
      "   - Field synonyms: Map common synonyms to canonical keys. Examples:\n",
      "       Invoice No., Invoice #: INVOICE_NUMBER\n",
      "       Invoice Date, Date of Issue: DATE_OF_ISSUE\n",
      "       Terms & Conditions, Payment Terms: PAYMENT_TERMS\n",
      "       Total Amount Due, TOTAL: TOTAL_AMOUNT or BALANCE_DUE if labeled \"Balance Due\"\n",
      "   - Line items:\n",
      "       - Identify table headers such as \"Description\", \"Unit Price\", \"Quantity\", \"Qty\", \"Amount\", \"Total\" to infer column order.\n",
      "       - If headers exist, parse each row mapping columns accordingly.\n",
      "       - If headers are absent, detect repeating patterns: text line(s) followed by numeric/monetary values; group them as item rows. Use proximity and ordering to assign DESCRIPTION, UNIT_PRICE, QTY, AMOUNT.\n",
      "       - If multiple monetary values appear in a row, assume common order Unit Price -> Quantity -> Amount unless an explicit header indicates otherwise.\n",
      "       - If mapping of numeric values to item fields is ambiguous, still attempt the most logical mapping (based on header text or consistent column counts). If mapping cannot be confidently made for an item, omit uncertain fields for that item rather than invent values.\n",
      "   - Totals selection: Prefer monetary values labeled with keywords \"Total\", \"Total Amount Due\", \"Balance Due\" appearing near the end of the document. If multiple candidate totals exist, choose the one explicitly labeled TOTAL, \"TOTAL AMOUNT DUE\", or \"Balance Due\". Only include SUBTOTAL if a distinct \"Subtotal\" label exists.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Handling ambiguous or partial information\n",
      "   - Only output fields you can reasonably extract. Do not invent or infer values beyond clear contextual evidence.\n",
      "   - Do not create extra keys not in the canonical schema.\n",
      "   - If a field exists but is ambiguous (e.g., multiple invoice numbers), choose the one explicitly labeled \"Invoice Number\" or the clearest candidate; otherwise omit and leave key out.\n",
      "   - If line items cannot be fully parsed into DESCRIPTION/UNIT_PRICE/QTY/AMOUNT, still include the ITEMS array and include whatever fields could be confidently extracted for each item.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Examples of mapping decisions (quick reference)\n",
      "   - \"Invoice Date: 05/01/2023\" with US address -> DATE_OF_ISSUE = \"2023-05-01\"\n",
      "   - \"1 x\" or \"1x\" in quantity column -> QTY = \"1\" (or QTY_NUM = 1)\n",
      "   - \"TOTAL AMOUNT DUE $625.00\" -> TOTAL_AMOUNT = \"$625.00\" and TOTAL_AMOUNT_NUM = 625.00 (optional numeric)\n",
      "   - \"Terms & Conditions: Payment is due within 30 days.\" -> PAYMENT_TERMS = \"Payment is due within 30 days.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Output examples\n",
      "   - Minimal example:\n",
      "     {\"INVOICE_NUMBER\":\"INV-00001\",\"DATE_OF_ISSUE\":\"2023-01-01\",\"CUSTOMER_NAME\":\"ABC Corporation\",\"ITEMS\":[{\"DESCRIPTION\":\"Thermostat Replacement\",\"UNIT_PRICE\":\"$150.00\",\"QTY\":\"2\",\"AMOUNT\":\"$300.00\"}],\"TOTAL_AMOUNT\":\"$625.00\",\"PAYMENT_TERMS\":\"Payment is due within 30 days.\",\"BANK_NAME\":\"National Bank\",\"ACCOUNT_NUMBER\":\"9876543210\",\"CURRENCY\":\"USD\"}\n",
      "\n",
      "9. When to ask clarifying questions\n",
      "   - If the text is extremely ambiguous (e.g., many unlabeled monetary values and no headers) and the user likely expects a specific mapping, it's acceptable to provide the best-effort JSON but also offer that you can re-run with a requested mapping rule. However, do not include that prompt in the JSON output — any follow up question should be outside the JSON response.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Do not include\n",
      "   - Do not include provenance, rationale, or extraction notes in the JSON.\n",
      "   - Do not include any keys outside the canonical schema.\n",
      "   - Do not return multiple JSON objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Implementation hints for the extractor (for internal use)\n",
      "- Preprocess: normalize whitespace, convert repeating line-break blocks to separators, preserve ordering.\n",
      "- Use regexes to find labeled fields (Invoice Number, Date of Issue, Phone, Email, Bank, Account).\n",
      "- Detect table headers and column boundaries; parse rows accordingly.\n",
      "- If no headers, perform pattern-based grouping: text chunk + 2–3 numeric/monetary tokens -> an item.\n",
      "- Validate totals: if ITEMS have AMOUNT_NUM values and their sum equals a detected TOTAL_AMOUNT_NUM, prefer that mapping; otherwise still trust explicit \"TOTAL\" labeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Follow these instructions exactly and return only the JSON object with the allowed canonical keys present when their values are extracted from the text.\n",

      "- Identify item region by headers like DESCRIPTION, QTY, QTY, PRICE, TOTAL, HRS, RATE, AMOUNT or by repeated row patterns.\n",
      "- Heuristics for detecting rows:\n",
      "  - A line with two or more monetary tokens or numeric columns is likely an item line.\n",
      "  - Repeated pattern across multiple lines suggests item table.\n",
      "- Column mapping:\n",
      "  - DESCRIPTION: textual column left-most; join wrapped desc lines to form full description.\n",
      "  - QTY: integer quantity. Detect headers \"Qty\", \"Quantity\", \"QTY\". Parse as integer; if parsing fails or not clearly integer, set QTY to null.\n",
      "  - HOURS: detect \"HRS\", \"HOURS\", \"hr\", \"hrs\", \"hour\" — parse as number (integer or float).\n",
      "  - UNIT: textual unit token (e.g., \"hr\", \"pcs\", \"each\") if present.\n",
      "  - RATE and AMOUNT: preserve currency symbol and number as strings exactly as found (may normalize thousands separators).\n",
      "- If both QTY and HOURS columns are present and clear, populate both.\n",
      "- If numbers are ambiguous or cannot be confidently parsed into QTY (integer) or HOURS (number), set those numeric fields to null.\n",
      "- DESCRIPTION should not include numeric columns. If a description spans multiple lines, merge successive lines until numeric columns encountered.\n",
      "- For each item row produce an ITEM object with exact keys: DESCRIPTION (string or null), QTY (integer or null), HOURS (number or null), UNIT (string or null), RATE (string or null), AMOUNT (string or null).\n",
      "\n",
      "MONETARY & NUMERIC PARSING RULES\n",
      "- QTY must be integer when parsed. If token contains \"1x\" or \"1 x\" treat as 1 and set UNIT to \"x\" if clear.\n",
      "- HOURS may be float (e.g., \"2.5\") or integer.\n",
      "- Do not attempt to compute totals from items — only map values present. If subtotal/total can be calculated and matches labeled total, that is a check but do not invent unlabeled totals.\n",
      "- Preserve currency symbols in RATE/AMOUNT strings.\n",
      "\n",
      "ERROR AVOIDANCE & COMMON MISTAKES (explicit)\n",
      "- Do not output keys not in the exact top-level list.\n",
      "- Do not return empty strings. Use null.\n",
      "- ITEMS must always be present (array).\n",

      "\n",
      "IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY (recommended step-by-step)\n",
      "1. Preprocess:\n",
      "   - Clean OCR artifacts: fix encoding issues (â‚¹ -> ₹), remove repeated punctuation, collapse multi-spaces, rejoin split tokens and numbers.\n",
      "   - Keep lines but normalize whitespace.\n",
      "2. Identify header region (top ~6-12 lines or until a clear blank separation) to find PAY_TO/vendor, INVOICE_NO and DATE.\n",
      "3. Extract labeled fields first using the label lists above. For each label find the nearest token(s) after the label.\n",
      "4. Normalize extracted emails, phones, account numbers as specified.\n",
      "5. Collect all currency-like tokens (symbol+number or number+currency code). Use labeled monetary values to assign SUBTOTAL/TAX/TOTAL/DISCOUNT; otherwise apply selection priority.\n",
      "6. Detect item table region by scanning for headers or repeated row patterns. Parse rows into ITEM objects using header mapping; when headers absent use heuristics (lines with multiple numeric/currency tokens).\n",
      "7. Extract PAYMENT_TERMS, TERMS, NOTES from blocks labeled or from footer area.\n",
      "8. Determine CURRENCY: if one currency symbol dominates mapped monetary tokens set CURRENCY to that ISO; otherwise null.\n",
      "9. Final checks:\n",
      "   - Ensure JSON has exactly the required top-level keys.\n",
      "   - Ensure types match schema (convert QTY/HOURS to numeric types).\n",
      "   - Replace missing values with null and ensure ITEMS is an array.\n",
      "\n",
      "ADDITIONAL NOTES & examples of fixes\n",
      "- Repair split tokens: \"rea l l ygreatsite\" -> \"reallygreatsite\".\n",
      "- Join account numbers: \"0012-3456-7890\" -> \"001234567890\" internally; output ACCOUNT_NUMBER must be digits-only string \"001234567890\".\n",
      "- Phone: \"+123-456-7890\" -> \"+1234567890\".\n",

      "- When labels are present, prefer labeled values even if there are other unlabeled candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "11) Ambiguity, inference, and missing data\n",
      "- Never invent values. If a canonical field is not present or cannot be reliably extracted, omit it from the output.\n",
      "- If a value is ambiguous, return the original substring rather than guessing.\n",
      "- If multiple unlabeled candidates exist, choose the most prominent/topmost occurrence.\n",

      "- Prefer seller data from the topmost header area unless a \"Bill To\" block clearly indicates otherwise.\n",
      "- When multiple totals appear, prefer the value with a \"Total\" label for TOTAL_AMOUNT; use \"Amount due\"/\"Balance\" labels for TOTAL_AMOUNT_DUE.\n",
      "\n",
      "13) NOTES and miscellaneous text\n",
      "- Extract visible notes, terms, or messages into NOTES (e.g., \"Thank you for your business!\", \"Terms & Conditions\", payment notes). Preserve original text and trim whitespace.\n",
      "- If payment instructions or terms appear in header/footer, put them into PAYMENT_METHOD, PAYMENT_TERMS, BANK_* or NOTES as labeled.\n",

      "- When extracting numeric tokens internally, remove thousands separators for comparisons but keep original strings in output.\n",
      "- When constructing LINE_ITEMS, include RAW whenever numeric mapping is ambiguous or tokens were taken from separated fragments; RAW must be the exact original snippet used.\n",

      "   - Recognize common separators and formats (/, -, ., spaces, month names, ordinal suffixes). When month names present, treat as unambiguous and convert to ISO.\n",

      "CURRENCY and AMOUNT RULES\n",
      "1. Preserve the original currency symbol and formatting in any amount string returned (e.g., \"$2,100.00\" remains \"$2,100.00\"). Do not reformat amounts.\n",
      "2. Populate CURRENCY with an ISO 4217 code when the currency symbol or explicit currency name is recognizable:\n",

      "   - € → EUR\n",
      "   - £ → GBP\n",
      "   - ¥ → JPY\n",
      "   - If a currency name or ISO code appears explicitly (AUD, CAD, SGD, USD, EUR, etc.), use that exact code.\n",
      "   - If a symbol is ambiguous and no explicit name appears, you may set CURRENCY to the raw symbol (e.g., \"$\").\n",
      "3. When you need to parse numeric values internally (for decisions or computations), strip thousands separators (commas, spaces) and parse digits and decimal points. Never change the original extracted strings in the output.\n",
      "4. Total selection priority (use labels to map totals):\n",
      "   - TOTAL_AMOUNT: prefer values explicitly labeled \"Total\", \"Total amount\", \"Invoice Total\", \"Invoice total\", \"Invoice Total:\" (case-insensitive).\n",
      "   - TOTAL_AMOUNT_DUE: prefer values labeled \"Amount due\", \"Amount Due\", \"Balance\", \"Balance Due\", \"Total Amount Due\".\n",

      "\n",
      "LINE ITEMS (LINE_ITEMS) — detection and mapping\n",
      "1. Detect logical line items where a description and related numeric values appear together (same line or in obvious columns). Create one object per logical item in original order.\n",
      "2. Recognize patterns: DESCRIPTION [QUANTITY] [UNIT_PRICE] [LINE_TOTAL] and variations such as HOURS/PRICE/TOTAL or QTY/UNIT/AMOUNT. If the document is tabular and the same column pattern repeats across lines, use column positions to map fields.\n",
      "3. If a description is on one line and numeric tokens follow on subsequent lines (e.g., Description newline Unit Price newline Qty newline Amount), treat the smallest contiguous snippet that contains the description and its numeric tokens as RAW.\n",
      "4. QUANTITY:\n",
      "   - If the quantity token is a plain integer (digits only, e.g., \"1\", \"10\", \"3\"), return it as a number type.\n",
      "   - If it contains non-numeric characters (e.g., \"1x\", \"2 hrs\"), return it as a string exactly as found (trimmed).\n",
      "5. RAW: include RAW for a line item whenever:\n",
      "   - any ambiguity exists in mapping numeric tokens to the description, OR\n",
      "   - numeric parts were taken from different tokens/lines (non-single-line), OR\n",
      "   - the smallest contiguous original text snippet used to construct the item is not a single neat line. RAW must be the exact original snippet (preserve newlines and spacing within that snippet, trimmed overall).\n",
      "   - If mapping is impossible, RAW should be \"Could not map amounts to descriptions\".\n",
      "6. Do not invent quantities/prices. If a missing line total can be unambiguously computed from qty × unit price (both numeric and unambiguous), you may compute it and include it as LINE_TOTAL (formatted as a string preserving currency symbol if present). If any ambiguity exists, omit computed values and rely on RAW.\n",
      "7. Only include DESCRIPTION, QUANTITY, UNIT_PRICE, LINE_TOTAL, RAW fields that are actually present or computed per above. Do not include null placeholders.\n",
      "\n",
      "PHONE NUMBERS and EMAILS\n",
      "1. Extract phone numbers preserving original formatting: allow digits, spaces, dashes, parentheses, plus signs. Typical patterns: \"+1 (555) 555-5555\", \"(555) 555-5555\", \"555-555-5555\", \"0123 4567 8901\".\n",
      "2. Extract emails using standard local@domain pattern and preserve original.\n",
      "3. Assignment to SELLER_PHONE and BUYER_PHONE:\n",

      "INVOICE NUMBER DETECTION\n",
      "1. Recognize labels (case-insensitive): \"Invoice Number\", \"Invoice No.\", \"Invoice #\", \"Invoice NO.\", \"INV-\", \"No.\", \"Invoice\" near an identifier. Extract the invoice identifier exactly as found (trimmed). Do not modify/infer formats.\n",
      "\n",
      "BANK & PAYMENT DETAILS\n",
      "1. Extract BANK_NAME, ACCOUNT_NAME (account holder), and ACCOUNT_NUMBER when present. Recognize labels: \"Bank name:\", \"BANK DETAILS\", \"Account No:\", \"Account number:\", \"Account Name:\", \"Account:\", \"Account holder\", \"Account No.:\" etc. Preserve original formatting of account numbers.\n",
      "2. PAYMENT_METHOD: extract explicit payment method text when present (\"Bank transfer\", \"Credit card\", \"PayPal\"); if only bank details are present, you may synthesize PAYMENT_METHOD by concatenating the raw bank/payment instruction text (e.g., \"Borcelle Bank; Account name: Olivia Wilson; Account number: 0123 4567 8901\"). Keep that synthesized text as a string exactly trimmed.\n",
      "3. PAYMENT_TERMS: extract text like \"Net 30\", \"Payment is due within 30 days\", \"Due on receipt\", \"Payment is due within 14 business days.\" Preserve wording exactly (trimmed).\n",
      "\n",
      "ADDRESS HANDLING and CLEANING\n",
      "1. Collapse multi-line addresses into a single string with components separated by commas. Example: [\"line1\", \"line2\", \"city\", \"state postal\"] → \"line1, line2, city, state postal\".\n",
      "2. Remove duplicate spacing; remove stray leading/trailing commas. Preserve punctuation necessary for meaning.\n",
      "3. SELLER_* should be taken from a \"From\", \"Supplier\", \"Vendor\", \"PAY TO\", or header/topmost contact block. BUYER_* should come from \"Bill To\", \"Bill To:\", \"To:\", \"Invoice to\", \"BILL TO\", \"Customer:\", \"Client:\" blocks.\n",
      "4. If addresses are multi-line but no clear label exists, associate the topmost contact block as SELLER and a lower \"Invoice to\"/\"Bill to\" block as BUYER.\n",
      "\n",
      "MAPPING SYNONYMS & LABELS\n",

      "GENERAL PRINCIPLES (do NOT invent or guess)\n",
      "- Prefer explicitly labeled values. Ranking for candidate selection:\n",
      "  1) Explicit label (e.g., \"Invoice No\", \"Invoice #\", \"Date:\", \"Total:\")\n",
      "  2) Nearby unlabeled value (near header or known section)\n",
      "  3) Largest matching token for totals if unlabeled\n",
      "- Never invent values. If uncertain or ambiguous, return null.\n",
      "- If multiple invoices appear, extract from the first invoice only.\n",
      "- Merge/sanitize typical OCR corruption: coalesce broken tokens (e.g., \"re al l y\" -> \"really\"), remove repeated punctuation, fix common mis-encodings (e.g., \"â‚¹\" -> \"₹\"), join number fragments split by spaces/hyphens (\"0012-3456\" -> \"00123456\" for parsing).\n",
      "- Rejoin lines that belong together (addresses, multi-line descriptions).\n",
      "- Do not return empty strings; use null.\n",
      "\n",
      "NORMALIZATION RULES\n",
      "- Collapse multiple spaces; remove spurious repeated punctuation.\n",
      "- Remove spaces inserted inside emails, phone numbers, and account numbers; coalesce broken tokens.\n",
      "- For ACCOUNT_NUMBER: remove any non-digit characters and return digits-only string or null if no digits.\n",
      "- For PHONE fields: remove spaces, parentheses, dots; preserve leading '+' if present; return compact string starting with '+' when present or digits only otherwise (e.g., \"+123456789\" or \"0123456789\").\n",
      "- For EMAIL: normalize to lowercase and remove OCR-inserted spaces or stray characters.\n",
      "- For BSB/routing codes: preserve digits/letters as found (trim whitespace).\n",
      "- Monetary values: preserve currency symbol/text as found in the invoice string. It is acceptable to remove thousands separators (commas) but not required. Do not invent currency symbols.\n",
      "\n",
      "DATE PARSING\n",
      "- Look for labels: \"Date\", \"Invoice Date\", \"Date :\". If unambiguous, convert to ISO \"YYYY-MM-DD\".\n",
      "- Supported formats: DD/MM/YYYY, D/M/YY, MM/DD/YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD, \"23 March 2025\", \"15 December, 2026\", etc.\n",
      "- If ambiguous (e.g., \"02/05/2021\" with no locale context), return the original cleaned date string exactly as extracted.\n",
      "- If multiple dates present, prefer labeled \"Invoice Date\" or the one nearest the invoice header.\n",
      "\n",
      "INVOICE NUMBER\n",
      "- Look for labels: \"Invoice No\", \"Invoice #\", \"Invoice number\", \"No:\", \"Invoice :\".\n",
      "- Extract the nearest token after such a label; strip leading non-alphanumeric punctuation. Accept alphanumeric IDs.\n",
      "- If none labeled, consider a prominent short header token as invoice number.\n",
      "\n",
      "EMAIL\n",
      "- Extract token containing '@'. Normalize to lowercase and remove spaces/stray chars inserted by OCR.\n",
      "- Only populate EMAIL; do not populate web sites or other contact forms.\n",
      "\n",
      "PHONE FIELDS (BILL_TO_PHONE, PAY_TO_PHONE)\n",
      "- Look for \"Phone\", \"Tel\", \"T:\", \"P:\" near bill/pay blocks.\n",
      "- Normalize as described above. Remove surrounding label text.\n",
      "\n",
      "BANK & ACCOUNT FIELDS (BANK_NAME, ACCOUNT_NAME, ACCOUNT_NUMBER, BSB)\n",
      "- Recognize labels: \"Bank\", \"Bank Name\", \"Account No\", \"Account Number\", \"Account :\", \"Account name\", \"BSB\", \"Routing\", \"Sort code\".\n",
      "- ACCOUNT_NUMBER returned must be digits-only (strip spaces, hyphens, letters). If no valid digits remain, return null.\n",
      "- ACCOUNT_NAME preserve capitalization/spelling as found after OCR cleaning.\n",
      "- BSB preserve characters/digits as found.\n",

      "CURRENCY & MONETARY FIELDS\n",
      "- Detect currency symbols: \"$\" -> USD, \"€\" -> EUR, \"£\" -> GBP, \"₹\" or \"â‚¹\" -> INR. If a symbol is used consistently and unambiguously, set CURRENCY to that ISO code. If multiple symbols or ambiguous, set CURRENCY to null.\n",
      "- Monetary fields (TAX, SUBTOTAL, DISCOUNT, TOTAL, RATE, AMOUNT) should preserve the currency symbol/text as found.\n",
      "- When mapping labeled totals, prefer explicit labels: \"Total\", \"TOTAL DUE\", \"Amount Due\", \"Subtotal\", \"Tax\", \"GST\", \"VAT\", \"Discount\".\n",
      "- Selection priority for totals:\n",
      "  - Use explicitly labeled amount for SUBTOTAL / TAX / TOTAL first.\n",
      "  - If unlabeled, the largest monetary token is likely TOTAL unless larger value is explicitly labeled SUBTOTAL.\n",
      "\n",
      "TAX & DISCOUNT\n",
      "- TAX_RATE: look for labels like \"Tax (10%)\", \"GST 10%\", \"VAT 20%\". Extract percentage string (e.g., \"10%\").\n",
      "- TAX: monetary amount labeled \"Tax\" or adjacent to TAX_RATE.\n",
      "- DISCOUNT_RATE and DISCOUNT: detect \"Discount (30%)\" or \"30% Discount\" and adjacent monetary discount.\n",
      "\n",
      "PAYMENT_TERMS, TERMS, NOTES\n",
      "- PAYMENT_TERMS: concise payment instruction(s) near \"Payment Terms\", \"Payment is due within X days\", or \"Please pay\". Prefer short sentences describing how/when to pay.\n",
      "- TERMS: longer terms & conditions block (can be same as PAYMENT_TERMS if no separate block).\n",
      "- NOTES: remaining short free-form notes, thank-you lines, or extra instructions. Combine multiple short notes with semicolons if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "ITEMS EXTRACTION (REQUIRED)\n",
      "- ITEMS must be an array. If no items found, return [].\n",
      "- Detect item rows by looking for repeated lines or table-like regions with two or more numeric/currency tokens, and by scanning for headers like \"DESCRIPTION\", \"QTY\", \"Quantity\", \"HRS\", \"HOURS\", \"UNIT PRICE\", \"PRICE\", \"RATE\", \"AMOUNT\", \"TOTAL\".\n",
      "- Common item patterns:\n",
      "  - DESCRIPTION [QTY] [UNIT PRICE] [AMOUNT]\n",
      "  - DESCRIPTION [HOURS] [RATE] [AMOUNT]\n",
      "- Map columns using headers if present. Heuristics:\n",
      "  - If a unit header contains \"hr\", \"hrs\", \"hour\" -> treat numeric column as HOURS (float allowed).\n",
      "  - If a numeric column looks like an integer count -> treat as QTY (integer).\n",
      "- Parse QTY/HOURS to numbers. QTY should be integer where possible. HOURS can be float. If parsing fails or ambiguous, set to null.\n",
      "- RATE and AMOUNT: strings as found (preserve currency symbol if present).\n",
      "- DESCRIPTION: textual description cleaned of OCR artifacts, not containing numeric columns. If description spans multiple lines, join adjacent description lines.\n",
      "- If an invoice has quantity tokens like \"1x\", parse as integer 1.\n",
      "- Populate both QTY and HOURS only if both clearly present.\n",
      "\n",
      "CONSERVATIVE HANDLING OF AMBIGUITY\n",
      "- If a piece of data could belong to either PAY_TO or BILL_TO and ambiguous, prefer:\n",
      "  - PAY_TO for seller/vendor fields (bank, account, vendor name/address).\n",
      "  - BILL_TO for customer fields (customer name, customer address).\n",
      "  - If still ambiguous, use proximity to the top-of-document for PAY_TO and lower blocks for BILL_TO.\n",
      "- If multiple candidates labeled the same exist, take the one nearest the invoice header or nearest the primary invoice label.\n",
      "- When uncertain about currency mapping, set CURRENCY to null.\n",
      "- Never return empty strings; use null.\n",
      "\n",
      "IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY (recommended step sequence)\n",
      "1. Normalize raw text: collapse whitespace, fix obvious OCR splits, map mis-encoded characters, remove repeated punctuation, join number fragments.\n",
      "2. Identify header region (top ~6-10 lines) to find PAY_TO/vendor, INVOICE_NO, and DATE.\n",
      "3. Find labeled fields first (Invoice No, Date, Total, Subtotal, Tax, Bank, Account); use proximity for unlabeled candidates.\n",
      "4. Gather currency-like tokens and candidate amounts; map labeled amounts to SUBTOTAL/TAX/TOTAL preferentially.\n",
      "5. Detect items by scanning for repeated patterns/rows with numeric tokens; map columns using headers if present and parse QTY/HOURS/RATE/AMOUNT conservatively.\n",
      "6. Extract emails, phones, bank details, payment terms, terms, notes.\n",
      "7. Validate types: ensure QTY/HOURS numeric values are numbers; account numbers digits-only; EMAIL lowercase; phone compact.\n",

      "- Monetary strings may contain currency symbol and commas; preserve or normalize thousands separators consistently but do not invent decimals.\n",
      "- For ambiguous dates like \"07/01/2023\": if the invoice contains locale indicator (e.g., \"USA\", \"United States\") prefer MM/DD/YYYY; if no locale, return the original cleaned string instead of guessing.\n",

      "- If no labeled total, the largest monetary value is likely TOTAL unless a larger value is explicitly labeled \"Subtotal\".\n",
      "- TAX_RATE: look for patterns like \"Tax (10%)\", \"GST 10%\", \"VAT 20%\". Extract percentage string like \"10%\".\n",

      "  - Look for headers like \"DESCRIPTION\", \"QTY\", \"Quantity\", \"HRS\", \"HOURS\", \"UNIT PRICE\", \"PRICE\", \"RATE\", \"AMOUNT\", \"TOTAL\" to map columns.\n",
      "  - Typical pattern: DESCRIPTION [QTY] [UNIT PRICE] [AMOUNT] OR DESCRIPTION [HOURS] [RATE] [AMOUNT].\n",
      "- For Hours vs Quantity:\n",
      "  - If header or unit contains \"hr\", \"hrs\", \"hour\", set HOURS (numeric). HOURS may be integer or float.\n",
      "  - If a column is clearly integer counts, set QTY (integer).\n",
      "  - If invoice shows both QTY and HOURS, populate both when clearly present.\n",
      "- Parse numeric QTY/HOURS to numbers: QTY should be integer when possible; HOURS may be float. If parsing fails or ambiguous, set QTY/HOURS to null.\n",
      "- RATE and AMOUNT: output as strings exactly as found (preserve currency symbol if present).\n",
      "- DESCRIPTION: textual description cleaned of OCR artifacts; do not include numeric columns. Join wrapped descriptions across lines when clearly belonging together.\n",

      "  - PAY_TO for seller/vendor fields (bank, account, vendor name/address)\n",
      "  - BILL_TO for customer fields (customer name, customer address)\n",
      "  - If still ambiguous use proximity to invoice header: top-of-document -> PAY_TO; lower/recipient blocks -> BILL_TO.\n",
      "- If multiple candidates labeled the same exist, take the one nearest the invoice header or nearest the primary invoice label.\n",
      "- When uncertain about currency detection, set CURRENCY to null rather than guessing.\n",

      "\n",

      "1. Normalize raw text: collapse multi-spaces, fix OCR splits, unify common mis-encoded characters, remove repeated punctuation, and join broken numeric tokens.\n",
      "2. Identify header region (top ~6-12 lines) to find PAY_TO/vendor and invoice number/date.\n",
      "3. Find labeled fields first (Invoice No, Date, Total, Subtotal, Tax, Bank, Account); use proximity for unlabeled candidates.\n",
      "4. Gather currency-like tokens and candidate amounts; map labeled amounts to SUBTOTAL/TAX/TOTAL preferentially.\n",
      "5. Detect items by scanning for repeated patterns/rows with numeric tokens; map columns using headers if present.\n",

      "   - Detect emails with regex [\\w\\.-]+@[\\w\\.-]+\\.\\w+.\n",
      "   - Detect phone numbers with common patterns (parentheses, hyphens, spaces). Extract as-is.\n",
      "   - Detect currency symbols and amounts (symbols: $, £, €, A$, C$). Remove thousands separators (commas) and normalize decimal separators to dot.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Invoice number:\n",
      "   - Look for lines containing \"Invoice No\", \"Invoice Number\", \"Invoice #\", \"Invoice:\", \"Invoice NO.\", \"Invoice NO\", \"Inv\", etc.\n",
      "   - Extract the token after the label. Trim punctuation. If multiple candidates, prefer one near the word \"Invoice\" or top of document.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Dates:\n",
      "   - Look for \"Date\", \"Date Issued\", \"Invoice Date\", \"Date:\" and variants. Also look for \"Service Date\" and \"Due Date\".\n",
      "   - If date format includes day/month/year and is clearly dd/mm/yyyy vs mm/dd/yyyy, try to normalize to YYYY-MM-DD; otherwise return raw found string.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Parties (seller/from and buyer/bill to):\n",
      "   - If both \"FROM\" and \"BILL TO\"/\"BILL TO:\" appear, use FROM → SELLER_*, BILL TO → BUYER_*.\n",
      "   - If only a \"Customer\" or company appears near top, infer BUYER_NAME.\n",
      "   - Combine adjacent lines until a blank line or another section label to build ADDRESS string.\n",
      "   - For email and phone, use regex anywhere in seller or buyer blocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Payment and bank details:\n",
      "   - Extract BANK_NAME from lines beginning with \"Bank\", \"Bank Name\".\n",
      "   - ACCOUNT_NAME or Account Name from \"Account Name\".\n",
      "   - ACCOUNT_NUMBER from \"Account No\", \"Account Number\", \"Acct No\", using digits and preserved separators.\n",
      "   - PAYMENT_METHOD if stated (e.g., \"PAYMENT METHOD\", \"Payment Method: Bank transfer\", \"Card\").\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Line item extraction (important):\n",
      "   - Identify the invoice's line-item table block by looking for section labels like DESCRIPTION, ITEM, QTY, QUANTITY, UNIT PRICE, PRICE, AMOUNT, TOTAL, HOURS, RATE, HOURS PRICE TOTAL, etc.\n",
      "   - For each non-header line in that block:\n",
      "      - Tokenize line into words and numeric tokens.\n",
      "      - If the line contains both a textual description and numeric tokens with currency symbols or decimals, assume the last numeric currency-like token is the LINE_TOTAL, the numeric token before that that looks like a monetary amount is the UNIT_PRICE, and a small integer token is the QUANTITY. If there are exactly two monetary tokens, assume UNIT_PRICE and LINE_TOTAL. If there is one monetary token and one small integer, assume unit price missing or quantity missing — fill what you can.\n",
      "      - If items are split across multiple lines (description wrapping), join lines until a numeric pattern appears that indicates the prices/qty for that item.\n",
      "      - QUANTITY: prefer integers; if missing set null.\n",
      "      - UNIT: if a separate column header indicates unit (hours, pcs), map to UNIT.\n",
      "      - Always populate DESCRIPTION (best-effort trimmed) even if numbers are ambiguous.\n",
      "   - If mapping of numeric tokens to quantity/unit_price/line_total is ambiguous, populate the fields you are confident in and set others to null, and put a short note in EXTRACTOR_NOTES describing ambiguity.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Totals:\n",
      "   - Look for \"Subtotal\", \"Sub total\", \"Total before tax\", extract nearest currency amount.\n",
      "   - Look for \"Tax\", \"VAT\", \"Sales Tax\", extract amount or percent if available.\n",
      "   - Look for \"Total\", \"Total Amount\", \"Amount Due\", \"Grand Total\" and set GRAND_TOTAL to the most specific final total (prefer lines labeled \"Total Amount Due\", \"Grand Total\", or the bottom-most monetary value if context suggests).\n",
      "   - If multiple totals and one is clearly sum of line items, set SUBTOTAL and GRAND_TOTAL accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Normalization specifics:\n",
      "   - Monetary values: remove currency symbols and commas, convert parentheses for negatives to a leading minus, and ensure two decimal digits. Examples: \"$2,250\" -> \"2250.00\", \"290.0\" -> \"290.00\", \"100\" -> \"100.00\".\n",
      "   - Quantities: remove commas, if decimal present keep it.\n",
      "   - Addresses: join adjacent address lines with comma and single space; remove duplicate lines.\n",
      "   - Names: title-case or preserve original casing as found.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Ambiguity and EXTRACTOR_NOTES:\n",
      "   - If mapping of item amounts to descriptions is ambiguous, set EXTRACTOR_NOTES to a concise explanation of the ambiguity and which fields were left null.\n",
      "   - If you normalized or changed dates, mention original format in EXTRACTOR_NOTES.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Output formatting:\n",
      "   - JSON only. Use null for missing values, numeric monetary and quantity values as strings formatted as specified.\n",
      "   - ITEMS must be an array (possibly empty).\n",
      "   - Do not include any fields other than those listed in the Schema.\n",

      "Extraction/normalization rules and priorities\n",
      "- Seller vs Buyer:\n",
      "  - If text shows a header/top-left block (company name, \"Invoice from\", or large title) treat as seller (seller_* fields).\n",
      "  - If labeled \"Bill to\", \"Invoice to\", \"Billed to\", \"To:\" etc., treat as buyer (buyer_*).\n",
      "  - If a phone/address/email appears near both seller and buyer, assign based on explicit labels; if ambiguous, prefer seller for header items and buyer for \"Bill to\" blocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Invoice number/date/due:\n",
      "  - Look for common labels: \"Invoice #\", \"Invoice No.\", \"Invoice number\", \"Date\", \"Date of Issue\", \"Due\", \"Pay by\", \"Due Date\".\n",
      "  - Normalize dates to ISO YYYY-MM-DD when unambiguous. If a date has day/month/year but ambiguous ordering, try to infer from common formats; if ambiguous, set null.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Money & currency:\n",
      "  - Detect currency symbols (e.g., $, £, €) and currency codes (USD, GBP, EUR). If symbol present, map to ISO code when unambiguous (e.g., $ → USD). If multiple different currency symbols or codes appear, set \"currency\" to null.\n",
      "  - Parse monetary numbers by removing thousands separators (commas/dots where appropriate) and converting to numbers. Accept both \"$1,234.56\" and \"1.234,56\" style where context makes sense; if parsing ambiguous, set numeric fields to null.\n",
      "  - Subtotal/tax/total: look for labels \"Subtotal\", \"Tax\", \"Tax Rate\", \"Total Amount\", \"Total\". For tax_rate prefer a percent number (e.g., \"10%\" -> 10). If only tax amount is present and no explicit tax rate, set tax_rate null and set tax_amount to parsed number.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Line items:\n",
      "  - Extract each visible line item into an object with description, quantity, unit_price and line_total.\n",
      "  - Common patterns: \"Description | Qty | Unit Price | Total\" or rows like \"1 Logo 1 $500 $500\". Use proximity to assign fields.\n",
      "  - Quantity: parse as number; accept \"1x\", \"1\", \"Qty 1\". If quantity missing but line_total and unit_price present and unit_price non-zero, you may infer quantity = line_total / unit_price and round to reasonable precision; otherwise set quantity null.\n",
      "  - Unit price / line total: parse numeric as described above. If only one monetary value is present per line and there is a separate \"Amount\" column, use that as line_total and set unit_price null unless quantity allows inference.\n",
      "  - If items table is present but misaligned, do your best to assign columns consistently; if ambiguous, prefer to populate description and line_total and leave other fields null.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Contact detection:\n",
      "  - Phone: sequences of digits with separators, optional leading +. Return as string.\n",
      "  - Email: detect standard email format.\n",
      "  - Website: detect strings like \"www.\" or \"http\".\n",
      "\n",

      "- Precision & safety:\n",
      "  - Do not invent or guess strongly when data is ambiguous. Prefer null over incorrect normalized values.\n",
      "  - Do not emit extra keys or helper fields.\n",
      "  - If multiple candidates exist for a field (e.g., two \"Total\" lines), choose the one that appears near the invoice footer or is labeled clearly \"Total\" or \"Total Amount\". If still ambiguous, set total null.\n",

      "- If a discount is shown both as percent and an amount (e.g., \"30% / $375.00\"), place the shown amount in DISCOUNT and the percent text (e.g., \"30%\") in PAYMENT_TERMS or in the same DISCOUNT field as a combined string (\"30% / $375.00\"). Do not create extra keys.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Party / contact extraction rules\n",
      "- Distinguish seller (the entity issuing the invoice) and bill-to/customer (entity being billed) when possible. Use SELLER_* keys for issuer and BILL_TO_* keys for recipient.\n",
      "- If the invoice only contains one block of contact info labeled \"Customer\" or \"Bill To\", map that to BILL_TO or the appropriate BILL_TO_* fields.\n",
      "- Normalize email and website text by removing extra spaces and correcting obvious spacing errors in addresses/emails (e.g., \"hello @example .com\" → \"hello@example.com\"); but do not change names or company names beyond trimming whitespace.\n",
      "- Phone numbers: extract as presented.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Dates and numbers\n",
      "- Extract dates as they appear in the invoice (do not convert formats). Use INVOICE_DATE for the invoice's main date. If the invoice uses a label \"Date of Issue\" or similar, map to DATE_OF_ISSUE. If both are present, include both keys.\n",
      "- Infer CURRENCY by symbol: $ → \"USD\", £ → \"GBP\", € → \"EUR\". If no symbol present but currency code is present (USD, GBP, EUR, etc.), use that code. Put result in CURRENCY.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) Payment and bank details\n",
      "- Extract PAYMENT_TERMS and PAYMENT_METHODS (free text as on invoice).\n",

      "- If PayPal address is shown, set PAYPAL_EMAIL to the email found.\n",
      "\n",
      "8) Heuristics and parsing strategy (recommended)\n",
      "- Search for section headings and common keywords to locate fields: \"Invoice\", \"Invoice No\", \"Invoice #\", \"Invoice Number\", \"Date\", \"Due\", \"Bill To\", \"Billed To\", \"Customer\", \"Pay To\", \"From\", \"Total\", \"Subtotal\", \"Tax\", \"Amount Due\", \"Terms\", \"Payment\", \"Bank\", \"IBAN\", \"SWIFT\", \"Paypal\".\n",
      "- For line items, detect tabular blocks where rows contain a description and 1–3 columns for unit price, qty/hours, and amount. Use column headers when available to map columns; otherwise infer by patterns (amounts typically include currency symbol or decimals).\n",
      "- Treat top-of-document blocks as likely seller info, and blocks labeled \"Billed to\" / \"Bill To\" / \"Customer\" as bill-to info.\n",
      "- Clean obvious OCR spacing or punctuation noise in emails/websites and numeric values, but do not invent missing numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "9) Strictness about keys\n",
      "- Do NOT produce keys beyond those listed in section 2.\n",
      "- Do NOT add an \"ITEMS\" combined string or other aggregated textual keys—use the numbered ITEM_n_* format.\n",
      "- If a specific field can't be found, simply omit the key.\n",
      "\n",
      "10) Examples of expected outputs (conceptual)\n",
      "- If invoice has three line items, output ITEM_1_DESCRIPTION, ITEM_1_UNIT_PRICE, ITEM_1_QTY, ITEM_1_AMOUNT; ITEM_2_..., ITEM_3_...\n",
      "- If invoice shows \"Rate\" and \"Hours\" columns, ITEM_n_UNIT_PRICE should contain the rate string (e.g., \"$50/hr\" or \"$50.00\") and ITEM_n_QTY should contain hours (e.g., \"4\").\n",

      "NORMALIZATION & OCR CLEANING GUIDELINES\n",
      "- Collapse multiple spaces into single space, trim leading/trailing whitespace.\n",
      "- Merge tokens split by spaces/hyphens inside words or numbers (e.g., \"re al\" -> \"real\", \"123-456-789\" -> \"123456789\").\n",
      "- Coalesce emails/phones/account numbers split across whitespace/punctuation.\n",
      "- Repair common OCR misreads where obvious (e.g., \"â‚¹\" -> \"₹\", \"O\" vs \"0\" only when context is numeric and unambiguous).\n",
      "- Remove repeated punctuation sequences (\".....\", \"----\").\n",
      "- Rejoin address lines that clearly belong together into a single address string (comma-separated).\n",
      "\n",
      "PRIORITIZATION & PROXIMITY RULES\n",
      "- Header region (top 6-12 lines) usually contains invoice header, vendor (PAY_TO), invoice number and date. Use proximity to header for PAY_TO and invoice fields.\n",
      "- Customer (BILL_TO) is often below header and labeled \"Bill To\", \"Invoice To\", \"BILL TO\", etc. Use proximity to those labels.\n",
      "- For bank/account details, prefer fields nearer to vendor (PAY_TO) section.\n",
      "- If a piece of text could be either PAY_TO or BILL_TO and ambiguous, prefer PAY_TO for vendor/bank fields and BILL_TO for customer fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "DATE & NUMBER PARSING CAUTION\n",
      "- Only convert dates to ISO when unambiguous (e.g., \"15/08/2028\" -> 2028-08-15 is unambiguous as day >12; \"08/01/2023\" with country context like \"USA\" can be parsed as 2023-08-01).\n",
      "- For ambiguous numeric tokens (e.g., \"1,000\" vs \"1000\"), treat as monetary if near currency symbol or column headers.\n",
      "- QTY must be integer when confidently parsed; HOURS may be float.\n",

      "1. Normalize raw text: fix encoding errors, collapse spaces, merge split tokens, remove noise.\n",
      "2. Split into lines but preserve original ordering and allow re-joining wrapped lines based on heuristics (addresses, descriptions).\n",
      "3. Identify header region (top lines) and search there for PAY_TO/vendor, INVOICE_NO, DATE.\n",
      "4. Scan entire document for labeled fields (Invoice No, Date, Total, Subtotal, Tax, Bank, Account, Email, Phone) and map by label proximity.\n",
      "5. Collect all currency-like tokens; infer CURRENCY only if symbol usage is consistent and unambiguous.\n",
      "6. Detect item table(s) using headers or repeated numeric patterns; map columns to DESCRIPTION, QTY/HOURS, RATE, AMOUNT.\n",
      "7. Map labeled totals (Subtotal, Tax, Total, Discount) using explicit labels first; otherwise use largest amount heuristics.\n",

      "  - Lines containing two or more currency-like tokens or numeric amounts are likely item lines.\n",
      "  - If a header row exists, map columns accordingly.\n",
      "  - Use presence of \"hr\", \"hrs\", \"hour\" near numeric column to mark HOURS and UNIT \"hr\".\n",
      "- Parsing rules:\n",
      "  - DESCRIPTION: cleaned textual description without numeric columns. Join wrapped lines that clearly belong to a single description.\n",
      "  - QTY: integer when clearly present. Parse to integer; if ambiguous or fractional where context suggests hours, set null.\n",
      "  - HOURS: numeric (int or float). Parse decimals if present.\n",
      "  - UNIT: string like \"hr\", \"hrs\", \"pcs\", \"each\". Prefer normalized short forms (\"hr\", \"pcs\", \"each\").\n",
      "  - RATE and AMOUNT: strings as found (preserve currency symbol).\n",

      "- Remove repeated punctuation like \"....\" or \"----\".\n",
      "- Coalesce fragmented emails/phones/bank numbers split across whitespace or punctuation.\n",
      "- Repair obvious OCR character misreads conservatively (e.g., \"â‚¹\" -> \"₹\").\n",
      "- For addresses, join consecutive lines that belong to the same block (use proximity and labels like \"Address\", \"A :\", \"Address :\").\n",
      "\n",
      "RESOLUTION RULES FOR AMBIGUITY\n",
      "- When a piece could belong to PAY_TO (vendor) or BILL_TO (customer) and ambiguous:\n",
      "  - Prefer PAY_TO for vendor/seller fields (bank, account, vendor name/address).\n",
      "  - Prefer BILL_TO for customer fields (customer name, customer address).\n",
      "  - If still ambiguous, use proximity to header: top-of-document -> PAY_TO/vendor; lower/left-of-invoice -> BILL_TO/customer.\n",
      "- If conflicting totals exist (e.g., \"Total : $1,680\" and \"TOTAL DUE $12345\") prefer explicitly labeled \"TOTAL DUE\" or the one closest to the right/bottom totals area; if conflict and no clear preference, choose the labeled one; avoid inventing a reconciliation.\n",
      "\n",
      "IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY (recommended order)\n",
      "1. Normalize raw text: collapse multi-spaces, fix OCR splits, unify mis-encoded characters, remove repeated punctuation, join broken numeric tokens.\n",
      "2. Identify header region (top ~6 lines) to find vendor/PAY_TO and invoice number/date.\n",
      "3. Find labeled fields first (Invoice No, Date, Total, Subtotal, Tax, Bank, Account); use proximity for unlabeled candidates.\n",
      "4. Collect all currency-like tokens and candidate amounts; map labeled amounts to SUBTOTAL/TAX/TOTAL using label proximity.\n",
      "5. Detect items: find header row(s) or repeated row patterns; map columns; parse QTY/HOURS numerically when unambiguous.\n",
      "6. Extract emails/phones/bank info and normalize.\n",
      "7. Assemble PAYMENT_TERMS, TERMS, NOTES from labeled blocks or nearby sentences.\n",
      "8. Final validation: ensure JSON contains every top-level key exactly and ITEMS is an array. Ensure each ITEM has exactly the ITEM keys and types. Convert ambiguous numeric fields to null rather than guessing.\n",
