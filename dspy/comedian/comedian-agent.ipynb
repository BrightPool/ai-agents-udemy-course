      "Output format\n",

      "Audience calibration\n",
      "- Your joke should satisfy:\n",
      "  - A club owner who’s seen everything: demands originality and a punchy, surprising angle.\n",
      "  - A pro comedian: allergic to hacky, overused premises and groaner puns.\n",
      "  - A festival curator: looks for a distinctive voice and a fresh perspective.\n",
      "  - A critic: appreciates clear structure and a hint of smart social/cultural observation.\n",
      "  - A comedy-writing professor: values economy, tight setup–punch, and timing.\n",
      "\n",
      "What to avoid (based on prior reactions)\n",
      "- Don’t rely on a single, obvious pun or common trope (e.g., “culture grows on people,” “movies in therapy for unresolved sequels,” “Wi‑Fi and commitment issues,” “X walks into a bar,” random object “goes to therapy”).\n",
      "- Don’t be generic or predictable; skip filler tags that feel recycled.\n",
      "- No punching down, slurs, or needlessly cruel targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommended approach\n",
      "1. Narrow the topic to a specific, contemporary angle or vivid image.\n",
      "2. Brainstorm 3–5 premises; discard anything that feels familiar, hacky, or purely pun-driven.\n",
      "3. Choose the freshest premise and write a tight setup that leads to an unexpected, earned twist.\n",
      "4. Use one strong device (misdirection, semantic flip, framing shift, or compressed analogy). If you use wordplay, embed it in a novel premise with layered meaning.\n",
      "5. Prefer concrete, surprising imagery over generic abstractions; keep the language economical.\n",
      "6. Optionally add one short, smart tag only if it elevates the premise without feeling stock.\n",
      "7. Self-check:\n",
      "   - Would a jaded comic roll their eyes? If yes, rewrite.\n",
      "   - Is there a unique voice or observation? If not, sharpen.\n",
      "   - Is the structure clear (setup → turn → concise payoff)? Tighten if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Topical guidance examples\n",
      "- Entertainment: Avoid franchise/sequel therapy gags. Consider the business, audience behavior, awards-season rituals, or behind-the-scenes absurdities.\n",
      "- Culture: Avoid petri-dish “culture” puns. Explore museum etiquette, cross-cultural mix-ups, trend cycles, or how “taste” is performed.\n",
      "- Misunderstanding: Use a semantic misread or over-literal interpretation, but push to a fresh image or consequence beyond the first idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Style notes\n",
      "- Sound contemporary and confident; one clean, memorable line.\n",
      "- Clever beats cute; specific beats general; imagery beats clichés.\n",
      "- Keep it safe for a broad audience while remaining sharp.\n",

      "  - “X walks into a bar,” “random object goes to therapy.”\n",

      "1. Narrow: From the broad topic, pick a specific, contemporary micro-scene or behavior (e.g., backstage economics, how hype is manufactured, gallery etiquette, waiting-room choreography, portal UX).\n",

      "   - If you use wordplay, bury it inside a layered, novel idea—not as the whole joke.\n",
      "4. Land an earned, surprising twist with concrete imagery; if you add a tag, keep it very short and only if it heightens.\n",
      "5. Edit for economy and timing:\n",
      "   - Remove qualifiers, keep verbs active, cut adornments.\n",
      "   - Make sure the last word is the most specific, funniest image.\n",
      "\n",
      "Topical guidance\n",
      "- Entertainment: Avoid franchise/award-season therapy riffs; try audience rituals, the mechanics of manufactured hype, or backstage money math.\n",
      "- Culture: Skip petri-dish puns; explore how etiquette is policed, trend half-lives, taste as performance.\n",
      "- Misunderstanding: Use a crisp semantic misread or over-literal rule; push to a second consequence/image beyond the first obvious beat.\n",
      "- Appearance: Avoid “my look is my personality” or brand-y self-deprecation; focus on a concrete ritual or social pressure.\n",
      "- Therapy: Don’t touch subscriptions/invoices/attendance tropes; find an untraveled angle (e.g., unspoken etiquette, scheduling power dynamics).\n",

      "Task\n",
      "- From a given topic, write one original, funny, stage-worthy joke that could impress seasoned comedy professionals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Input\n",
      "- topic: a single word or short phrase (e.g., Entertainment, Culture, Misunderstanding).\n",
      "\n",
      "Output\n",
      "- Return only the joke text (no preamble, labels, or explanations).\n",
      "- Length: 1–2 sentences, ideally 15–35 words.\n",
      "- End on the funniest, most concrete word.\n",
      "- No emojis, hashtags, or filler tags.\n",
      "\n",
      "Audience calibration\n",
      "- Club owner: must feel genuinely new and punchy — not a warmed-over “social observation.”\n",
      "- Pro comedian: zero hack premises or groaner puns; the angle itself must surprise.\n",
      "- Festival curator: a distinctive voice and viewpoint, not a generic riff.\n",
      "- Critic: clear structure with a hint of smart cultural or social observation.\n",
      "- Writing professor: economy, tight setup→turn→payoff, precise timing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quality bar\n",
      "- Fresh premise first, clever phrasing second. Clever wording cannot rescue a stale idea.\n",
      "- Deliver a clean setup → unexpected turn → concise payoff. One short tag only if it clearly heightens the twist.\n",
      "- Use vivid, specific imagery; end on a crisp, concrete noun or verb.\n",
      "\n",
      "What to avoid\n",
      "- No single, obvious pun or stock trope.\n",
      "- Avoid these overused frames:\n",
      "  - “X is like a subscription,” “therapy made me committed to my invoices,” “Wi‑Fi has commitment issues.”\n",
      "  - “Healthcare is like streaming,” “sequels/movies/brands in therapy,” “culture grows on people.”\n",
      "  - “X walks into a bar,” “random object goes to therapy.”\n",
      "  - Self-aware fashion/appearance lines that read as branded indifference.\n",
      "- Also avoid well-worn high-level takes signaled in prior feedback:\n",
      "  - Generic “wealth is absurd” metaphors (e.g., reputation as furniture in storage; skip “legacy” framing).\n",
      "  - Performative generosity framed as accounting (“ledger,” “scoreboard” charity).\n",
      "  - Fashion/street-style as predation or birdwatching (“ruined wing,” “published as effortless”).\n",
      "- No punching down, slurs, or needlessly cruel targets; aim critiques upward or at systems/rituals.\n",
      "- Don’t rely on a single “X is like Y” cliché unless the analogy is distinctly novel and compressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommended approach\n",
      "1) Narrow the topic to a specific, contemporary angle or micro-scene:\n",
      "   - A behind-the-scenes ritual, a tiny etiquette rule, an odd tool/interface, or a moment of process the audience rarely sees.\n",
      "   - Prefer a first-person or sharply observed scene over broad “people do this” claims.\n",
      "2) Brainstorm 3–5 distinct premises silently; immediately discard anything you’ve heard in common club sets or on social media (subscriptions, streaming, therapy clichés, “Wi‑Fi commitment,” accounting-for-charity, predator-photographers, generic “wealth is absurd”).\n",
      "3) Choose the freshest premise and write a tight setup that invites one strong device:\n",
      "   - Misdirection, semantic flip, framing shift, compressed analogy, or a literal rule pushed to a second consequence.\n",
      "   - If wordplay appears, bury it inside a layered idea; never let a single pun carry the joke.\n",
      "4) Land an earned, surprising twist with concrete imagery; if adding a tag, make it one short beat that heightens the turn.\n",
      "5) Edit for economy and timing:\n",
      "   - Cut qualifiers and throat-clearing (“these days,” “anyway,” “so yeah”).\n",
      "   - Use active verbs and tangible nouns; end on the most specific, funniest word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Topical guidance\n",
      "- Entertainment: Skip franchise/award-season therapy gags; try audience rituals, backstage economics, hype manufacturing, seating politics, comp lists, or crew superstitions.\n",
      "- Culture: Avoid petri-dish “culture” puns; explore gallery etiquette, trend half-lives, how taste is performed/policed, museum signage, or gatekeeping micro-behaviors.\n",
      "- Misunderstanding: Use a crisp semantic misread or over-literal rule, then push to a second image/consequence beyond the obvious first beat.\n",
      "- Appearance/Therapy/Healthcare:\n",
      "  - Appearance: Avoid branded indifference or “my look is my personality” beats.\n",
      "  - Therapy: Don’t touch subscriptions/invoices/commitment clichés.\n",
      "  - Healthcare: Don’t compare to streaming/subscriptions; consider billing labyrinths, waiting-room choreography, portals/forms/UX, or medical office micro-theater.\n",
      "\n",
      "Self-check before submitting\n",
      "- Is the premise genuinely fresh, not just the wording?\n",
      "- Is there a clear setup → turn → payoff in 1–2 sentences?\n",
      "- Does it include one concrete, surprising image?\n",
      "- Is the language economical, with the strongest, most specific word last?\n",
      "- Would a jaded comic not roll their eyes? If unsure, rewrite silently and only output the best version.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deliverable\n",
      "- One joke that follows all of the above. Only the joke text, 1–2 sentences, 15–35 words, ending on a concrete, funniest word.\n",

      "- Return only the joke text as plain text (no preamble, labels, quotes, hashtags, emojis, or explanations).\n",
      "- Length: 1–2 sentences, ideally 15–35 words.\n",

      "- Club owner who’s seen everything: demands a fresh angle with a crisp, earned twist, not a clever-but-safe line.\n",
      "- Pro comedian: zero hack premises, no groaner puns, no tweet-y vibe; it must land live.\n",
      "- Festival curator: wants a distinctive voice and a memorable, specific perspective.\n",
      "- Critic: values clear structure, sharp writing, and a smart social/cultural observation.\n",
      "- Comedy-writing professor: expects economy, tight setup→turn, and timing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hard avoids (non-negotiable)\n",
      "- No single, obvious pun or one-note wordplay.\n",
      "- No stock templates: “X walks into a bar,” “objects go to therapy,” “Wi‑Fi vs commitment,” petri‑dish “culture grows on people,” franchise/sequel therapy.\n",
      "- Don’t lean on familiar premises unless the angle is unmistakably novel:\n",
      "  - “Disaster turned into a hustle/startup spin.”\n",
      "  - “Cats own the humans” dynamic.\n",
      "  - “Vengeance isn’t cinematic; it’s paperwork/shipping.”\n",
      "  - Generic domestic/marriage beats (lost sock, chores stalemate, ‘marriage is weird’) unless truly reimagined.\n",
      "  - Bureaucracy-as-grief cliches (e.g., insurance reducing catastrophe to forms) unless you uncover a new mechanism.\n",
      "- Avoid listy rule-of-three unless genuinely subverted; no filler tags (“these days,” “amirite,” “that’s just Monday,” “now more than ever”).\n",
      "- No punching down, slurs, or needlessly cruel targets.\n",
      "- Specifically avoid stale tech overlays:\n",
      "  - Religion-as-tech/app/loyalty/gamified salvation (points, tiers, QR codes at the pearly gates, CAPTCHAs for heaven).\n",
      "  - Identity-as-software (updates, release notes, patches, rollbacks, versioning).\n",
      "  - Any premise that reduces to “X but like an app/algorithm.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommended approach (process)\n",
      "1) Narrow the topic to a vivid, contemporary angle or image. Prefer behind-the-scenes behavior, quiet rules/etiquette, ritual mechanics, trend performance, or how status/meaning is performed.\n",
      "2) Brainstorm 3–5 distinct premises. Immediately cut anything familiar, tweet-y, pun-led, or broadly domestic unless the take feels unmistakably new. Quick test: would a jaded headliner say “I’ve heard that”? If yes, toss it.\n",
      "3) Choose the freshest premise and write one tight setup that clearly frames an expectation.\n",
      "4) Use one strong device only—misdirection, semantic flip, framing shift, or compressed analogy—and make the turn feel earned by the setup (motivated, not clever-for-its-own-sake).\n",
      "5) Heighten stakes or implication subtly: reveal a status rule, a cost, or a small transgression to give the turn weight beyond a cute image.\n",
      "6) Prefer specific nouns and surprising, concrete imagery over abstractions; use active verbs; trim every extra word.\n",
      "7) Pick your last word/phrase first and build to it; land on a charged, tactile image (object, place, gesture), not an adverb or vague abstraction.\n",
      "8) If using two sentences, let the second deliver a clean, hard turn—no soft tags afterward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Style and tone\n",
      "- Confident, compressed, stage-ready; no resigned or “isn’t that odd” shrug.\n",
      "- Not a pun, not a list, not a tweet; one clear swing with a memorable voice.\n",
      "- No rhetorical questions unless the question itself is the hit.\n",
      "- No parentheses or meta commentary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Freshness guardrails (extra sensitivity)\n",
      "- If the topic leans broad (marriage, pets, airlines, insurance, dating), your angle must be unusually specific (e.g., an unspoken rule, backstage ritual, micro-credential, odd etiquette).\n",
      "- Avoid default domestic or bureaucracy beats unless you reveal a mechanism we haven’t seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Self-check before returning\n",
      "- Is the angle genuinely unexpected (not “religion-as-loyalty-program,” “identity-as-update,” or “X as an app/algorithm”)?\n",
      "- Is the structure clear (setup → turn → concise payoff) with one device and tight timing?\n",
      "- Is there a subtle social/cultural observation (status performance, etiquette, institutional habit) embedded in the image?\n",
      "- Would a club owner not roll their eyes, and a pro comic not groan?\n",
      "- Are there zero filler tags, hacky tropes, stock setups, or list padding?\n",
      "- Does it end on the strongest, most surprising concrete word or phrase?\n",
      "- Does it fit 1–2 sentences and roughly 15–35 words?\n",
      "- Is it unmistakably original (doesn’t echo “cats-as-landlords,” “hustle-from-ruin,” “revenge-as-bureaucracy,” domestic sock clichés, or insurance-as-forms laments)?\n",

      "  - Personified receipts/grocery metaphors for regret (e.g., a scale printing a life-choices receipt).\n",
      "  - Domestic relationships framed as corporate meetings (agendas, minutes, CC’ing the therapist).\n",
      "  - Tech/app learning that ends with only talking to or being replaced by a device (e.g., chatting with a thermostat).\n",
      "  - Generic “wealth is absurd” metaphors (skip legacy/furniture-in-storage angles).\n",
      "  - Performative generosity as accounting (“ledger,” “scoreboard” charity).\n",

      "\n",
      "Hard avoids (based on prior reactions and common pitfalls)\n",
      "- Obvious trope scaffolds: “X walks into a bar,” “[object] goes to therapy,” “Wi‑Fi and commitment issues,” “culture grows on people,” “movies with unresolved sequels in therapy.”\n",
      "- Generic cynicism takes: “sports are rigged/scripted,” “everything is a subscription,” “elections are like shopping/flash sales,” “politicians as brand ads,” “life is an app update,” “social media is a slot machine” — unless you deliver a truly novel, concrete angle that transcends the trope.\n",
      "- One-note puns or premise-as-pun. If the joke works only as a single obvious pun, scrap it.\n",

      "- Culture: Avoid petri-dish puns. Explore museum etiquette, performed taste, trend churn, or cross-cultural misfires with a crisp consequence.\n",
      "- Misunderstanding: Use a semantic misread or over-literal interpretation, but push past the first idea to a specific, concrete fallout.\n",
      "- Sports: Sidestep “sports are fake” or “fan addiction” clichés; think front-office absurdities, tech in officiating, NIL/merch rituals, or the economics of spectacle from a fresh angle.\n",
      "- Political commentary: Skip shopping/flash-sale analogies and default cynicism. Find a crisp institutional quirk, ballot mechanics, language games, or media choreography with one telling image.\n",

      "Self-check before submitting\n",
      "- Freshness filter: If the premise can be summarized as “X is like [common domain: shopping/therapy/streaming/Wi‑Fi],” throw it out or radically reframe it.\n",
      "- Specificity test: Are there concrete nouns/images? If it’s generic, sharpen it.\n",

      "- Prefer a first-person micro-scene or sharply observed ritual over broad “people do this” claims.\n",
      "- Specificity over generality: micro-narratives and exact details beat vague takes.\n",
      "- If the first twist feels merely “cute,” escalate once more or darken the image — don’t settle at the obvious first beat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommended approach (use silently)\n",
      "1) Narrow the topic to a specific, contemporary micro-scene:\n",
      "   - A behind-the-scenes ritual, tiny etiquette rule, odd interface/tool, or rarely-seen moment of process (e.g., comp lists, seating politics, crew superstition, gallery signage, portal UX, waiting-room choreography, gatekeeping micro-behavior).\n",
      "2) Brainstorm 3–5 distinct premises; immediately discard anything you’ve heard in club sets or on social media.\n",
      "3) Choose the freshest premise and pick one strong device:\n",
      "   - Misdirection, semantic flip, framing shift, compressed but novel analogy, or a literal rule pushed to a second consequence.\n",
      "   - If any wordplay appears, bury it inside a layered idea; never let a single pun carry the joke.\n",
      "4) Draft a tight setup that invites the device; land a surprising, visual payoff. Add one short tag only if it clearly heightens the twist.\n",
      "5) Edit for economy and timing:\n",
      "   - Cut throat-clearing and qualifiers.\n",
      "   - Use active verbs and tangible nouns.\n",
      "   - Restructure so the funniest, most specific word is last.\n",
      "\n",
      "What to avoid\n",
      "- No single obvious pun or stock trope.\n",
      "- Avoid these overused frames:\n",
      "  - “X is like a subscription,” “therapy made me committed to my invoices,” “Wi‑Fi has commitment issues.”\n",
      "  - “Healthcare is like streaming,” “sequels/movies/brands in therapy,” “culture grows on people.”\n",
      "  - “X walks into a bar,” “random object goes to therapy.”\n",
      "  - Self-aware fashion/appearance lines that read as branded indifference.\n",
      "- Also avoid well-worn high-level takes flagged by prior feedback:\n",
      "  - Generic “wealth is absurd” metaphors (“legacy,” reputation as furniture in storage).\n",
      "  - Performative generosity as accounting (“ledger,” “scoreboard” charity).\n",
      "  - Fashion/street-style as predation or birdwatching imagery (“ruined wing,” “published as effortless”).\n",
      "  - Tired sub-frames like “paid in exposure” unless subverted with a novel, specific second consequence.\n",
      "  - Familiar climate/tech beats unless the angle is genuinely new and the payoff is sharper than a first-glance gag.\n",
      "- No punching down, slurs, or needlessly cruel targets; aim critique upward or at systems/rituals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Topical guidance\n",
      "- Entertainment: try audience rituals, backstage economics, hype manufacturing, seating politics, comp lists, crew superstitions.\n",
      "- Culture: explore gallery etiquette, trend half-lives, how taste is performed/policed, museum signage, gatekeeping micro-behaviors.\n",
      "- Misunderstanding: use a crisp semantic misread or over-literal rule, then push to a second consequence beyond the obvious first beat.\n",
      "- Appearance/Therapy/Healthcare:\n",
      "  - Appearance: avoid branded indifference or “my look is my personality.”\n",
      "  - Therapy: skip subscriptions/invoices/commitment clichés.\n",
      "  - Healthcare: avoid streaming/subscription comparisons; consider portals/forms/UX, billing labyrinths, waiting-room choreography, medical office micro-theater.\n",
      "\n",
      "Signals from reviewer feedback (bake these in)\n",
      "- Specific, surprising images land: e.g., “Lyft for my houseplants,” “voice memo of his shower.” Aim for that level of concrete weirdness.\n",
      "- Strong premises beat tidy wordcraft; novelty matters more than polish.\n",
      "- Push past surface complaints; add a sharper twist or darker beat if needed.\n",
      "- Tight structure and micro-narratives read as pro-level; make it stage-ready, not tweet-ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "Self-check before submitting\n",
      "- Is the premise genuinely fresh, not just cleverly worded?\n",
      "- Is there a clear setup → turn → payoff in 1–2 sentences?\n",
      "- Did you include one concrete, surprising image and end on that crisp final word?\n",

      "\n",
      "Goal\n",
      "- Write one funny, original joke based on the provided topic that could impress seasoned comedy professionals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Input\n",
      "- topic: a single word or short phrase (e.g., Entertainment, Culture, Misunderstanding).\n",
      "\n",
      "Output\n",
      "- Return only the joke text as plain text.\n",
      "- No preamble, labels, quotes, hashtags, emojis, or explanations.\n",
      "- Length: 1–2 sentences, ideally 15–35 words.\n",
      "- End on the strongest, most surprising concrete word or phrase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Audience Bar (what the joke must satisfy)\n",
      "- Club owner who’s seen everything: fresh angle, crisp, earned twist.\n",
      "- Pro comedian: no hack premises, no groaner puns.\n",
      "- Festival curator: distinctive voice, memorable perspective.\n",
      "- Critic: clear structure plus a touch of smart social/cultural observation.\n",
      "- Comedy-writing professor: economy, tight setup → turn, clean timing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hard Avoids\n",
      "- No single, obvious pun or one-note wordplay.\n",
      "- No stock templates: “X walks into a bar,” “objects go to therapy,” “Wi‑Fi vs commitment,” petri‑dish “culture grows on people,” franchise/sequel therapy, or any prefab frame.\n",
      "- Don’t lean on familiar premises unless the angle is unmistakably novel:\n",
      "  - Disaster-into-hustle/startup spin.\n",
      "  - “Cats secretly own the humans.”\n",
      "  - “Vengeance isn’t cinematic; it’s paperwork/shipping.”\n",
      "- Avoid listy rule-of-three unless you truly subvert it; no filler tags (“these days,” “amirite,” “that’s just Monday,” “now more than ever”).\n",
      "- No punching down, slurs, or needlessly cruel targets.\n",
      "- Specifically avoid stale tech overlays:\n",
      "  - Religion-as-tech/app/loyalty/gamified salvation (points, tiers, QR codes at the pearly gates, CAPTCHAs for heaven).\n",
      "  - Identity-as-software (updates, release notes, patches, rollbacks, versioning).\n",
      "  - Any premise that reduces to “X but like an app/algorithm.”\n",
      "- Extra stale angles flagged by industry feedback—avoid unless you truly subvert:\n",
      "  - Wellness clichés (detox/juice cleanse → personality reboot → yoga-instructor archetype).\n",
      "  - Politics as performative authenticity/apology with stagecraft props.\n",
      "  - Relationship lines that are pretty-but-soft: lyrical build with a flat, banal object payoff (e.g., “the remote”) unless the turn makes it unexpectedly charged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommended Approach\n",
      "1) Narrow the topic to one vivid, contemporary angle or image. Favor behind-the-scenes behavior, quiet rules/etiquette, ritual mechanics, trend performance, or how status/meaning is performed (e.g., awards-season rituals, museum etiquette, audience behavior).\n",
      "2) Brainstorm 3–5 distinct premises. Immediately discard anything familiar, tweet-y, pun-led, or that a jaded comic would say “I’ve heard that.”\n",
      "3) Choose the freshest premise and write one tight setup that clearly frames an expectation.\n",
      "4) Use one strong device only—misdirection, semantic flip, framing shift, or compressed analogy—and make the turn feel earned, not clever-for-its-own-sake.\n",
      "5) Prefer specific nouns and surprising, concrete imagery; keep verbs active; trim every extra word.\n",
      "6) Land the twist on the final word/phrase; make it a charged, concrete image rather than an adverb, abstraction, or soft tag.\n",
      "7) Optional: add one very short, smart tag only if it elevates the premise and isn’t stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Style & Tone Notes\n",
      "- Keep the voice distinctive but not purple; prioritize a laugh over poetic prettiness.\n",
      "- Avoid enumerating props or details unless it’s the subversion; one precise object often beats a list.\n",
      "- Present tense usually keeps it tight and immediate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Self-Check Before Returning\n",
      "- Is the angle genuinely unexpected (not religion-as-loyalty-program, identity-as-update, or “X as an app/algorithm”)?\n",
      "- Is there a clear setup → turn with tight economy (1–2 sentences, ~15–35 words)?\n",
      "- Is there a subtle, current social/cultural observation?\n",
      "- Would a club owner not roll their eyes, and a pro comic not groan?\n",
      "- Are there zero filler tags, hacky tropes, or listy padding?\n",
      "- Does it end on the strongest, most surprising concrete word or phrase?\n",
      "- Is it unmistakably original (not echoing “detox → yoga instructor,” “performative political apology,” “cats as landlords,” “revenge as bureaucracy”)?\n",
      "\n",
      "Deliverable\n",
      "- One joke, plain text only, following all rules above.\n",
