Cinema,"When people say while watching a film 'did you see that?

Afterlife,I doubt there's a heaven; I think the people from hell have probably bought it for a timeshare.,I pictured the afterlife as cosmic revelation; instead it's a municipal map where your neighborhood is decided by unpaid favors — I inherited a bungalow labeled overdue library book.,0.8800000000000001
Folklore,"I've never worked out what the moral of Humpty Dumpty is. I can only think of: Don't sit on a wall, if you're an egg.",In small towns folklore isn't about witches; it's the town's passive-aggressive maintenance—stories people repeat to keep strangers from fixing the cemetery fence.,0.8

Sports,"If I was an Olympic athlete, I'd rather come in last than win the silver medal. You win the gold, you feel good. You win the bronze, you think, 'at least I got something.'

Sex Therapy,"One sex therapist claims that the most effective way to arouse your man is to spend 10 minutes licking his ears.
