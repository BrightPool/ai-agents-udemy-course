            "{'answer': 'Summary — current approaches to structured reasoning with LLMs\\n\\nHigh‑level taxonomy\\n1) Stepwise prompting and decoding\\n- Chain‑of‑Thought (CoT) prompting: include exemplars that show intermediate reasoning steps to elicit multi‑step chains from the model (Wei et al., 2022). Works particularly well for large models; gives interpretable traces but can be plausibly wrong.\\n- Zero‑shot CoT: short natural prompt such as “Let’s think step‑by‑step” can elicit reasoning without exemplars (Kojima et al., 2022).\\n- Decoding/aggregation: Self‑Consistency samples many chains and aggregates final answers to improve robustness (Wang et al., 2022). Tradeoff: higher inference cost but greater accuracy.\\n\\n2) Decomposition and curriculum prompting\\n- Least‑to‑Most / Scratchpad: break difficult problems into ordered subproblems; prompt the model to solve subgoals sequentially. Useful for hierarchical or compositional tasks; requires designing decomposition templates or exemplars.\\n\\n3) Program‑aided / executable reasoning\\n- PAL / Program‑of‑Thoughts (PoT): instruct the model to produce runnable code (e.g., Python) as the reasoning trace and execute it with a sandboxed interpreter (Gao et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2022). Strength: removes arithmetic/symbolic execution errors, makes logic testable. Limitations: model can still produce incorrect program logic; executing model code requires strong sandboxing and security controls. MultiPoT (2024) and ensembles over program outputs extend robustness.\\n\\n4) Tool‑augmented acting and agents\\n- ReAct: interleave natural‑language reasoning traces with actions (API calls, retrieval) so the model can “reason to act” and “act to reason” (Yao et al., 2022/ICLR 2023). Improves grounded QA and interactive tasks.\\n- Toolformer, LangChain, ToolBench, ToolLLM: system and dataset work to teach models when/how to call external APIs and to build developer frameworks/agents that orchestrate tool calls (Schick et al. 2023; LangChain ecosystem 2023–24). Key concerns: hallucinated or unsafe tool calls, cost/latency, verification of tool results.\\n\\n5) Search, planning, and multi‑branch inference\\n- Tree of Thoughts (ToT): treat intermediate “thoughts” as nodes and explore a tree using generation + evaluation + search (Yao et al., 2023). Enables lookahead, backtracking, and planning; shows large gains on combinatorial puzzles. Costly in LLM queries.\\n- Graph of Thoughts, Buffer of Thoughts: generalizations that use graphs or cached thought‑templates to reduce repeated cost and increase reusability (2023–2024 work). Ongoing research focuses on efficiency (reduce LLM calls) and robust evaluation heuristics.\\n\\n6) Iterative refinement, reflection, and verification\\n- Self‑refinement / Reflexion: use model self‑feedback or environment interaction logs as supervision to iteratively improve outputs (recent agent work).\\n- Verification layer / symbolic checkers: combine LLMs with external verifiers (theorem provers, symbolic solvers, retrieval + fact checks) or LLM-based verifiers to detect/correct mistakes. This is especially used in high‑assurance domains.\\n\\nCross‑cutting tradeoffs and practical points\\n- Model scale: many structured methods (CoT, ToT, PoT) show emergence or large gains primarily with large models (100B+ parameters) though some methods (program execution) help smaller models for numeric accuracy.\\n- Compute & latency: sampling (Self‑Consistency), multi‑branch search (ToT), or many tool calls substantially increase cost and latency. Buffering/caching and model distillation are active mitigations.\\n- Interpretability vs. reliability: human‑readable chains aid debugging but can be confidently wrong (“plausible hallucinations”); ensemble, verification, or executable traces increase reliability.\\n- Safety & security: executing model‑generated code or allowing arbitrary tool calls requires sandboxing, input validation, strict resource limits, and monitoring for prompt‑injection attacks.\\n\\nRepresentative resources (start here)\\n- Chain‑of‑Thought: Wei et al., 2022 (NeurIPS/arXiv).\\n- Self‑Consistency: Wang et al., 2022 (ICLR/ArXiv).\\n- PAL / PoT: Gao et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2022.\\n- ReAct: Yao et al., 2022 (ICLR 2023).\\n- Toolformer: Schick et al., 2023.\\n- Tree of Thoughts: Yao et al., 2023 (NeurIPS).\\n- Buffer/Graph of Thoughts and MultiPoT: follow‑ups 2023–2024 (NeurIPS 2024 Buffer of Thoughts, Graph of Thoughts arXiv 2023, MultiPoT 2024).\\n\\nPractical recommendations\\n- For numeric/symbolic tasks: start with program‑aided prompting (PAL/PoT) + sandboxed execution; use multiple samples and majority vote.\\n- For constrained planning/combinatorics: use ToT/graph search when lookahead/backtracking is needed, but budget LLM calls; consider Buffer of Thoughts or caching reused subplans.\\n- For web/knowledge tasks: use ReAct/tool‑augmented agents combined with retrieval and a verification step; instrument and validate every tool call.\\n- Always add a verifier (unit checks, symbolic solver, or secondary model) if correctness is critical; sandbox any code execution and use strict policies for tool usage.\\n\\nIf you want, I can:\\n- Provide copy‑paste CoT and PoT prompt templates and recommended decoding settings (temperatures, sample counts).\\n- Produce a short runnable example (e.g., PAL prompt + safe Python runner) or a Tree‑of‑Thoughts demo trace with cost estimates.\\n- Compile a concise comparison table (methods vs. costs/when to use + direct paper links).\\n\\nWhich follow‑up would you like?', 'action': 'think_tool', 'tool_result': 'I will synthesize the search results into a structured summary covering: (1) prompting-based stepwise methods (Chain-of-Thought, Zero-shot CoT, Scratchpad, Least-to-Most) and decoding/aggregation (Self-Consistency); (2) program-aided/executable reasoning (PAL, PoT, MultiPoT) — mechanism, strengths, security needs; (3) tool-augmented acting (ReAct, Toolformer, LangChain, planner+executor patterns) — best uses and evaluation concerns; (4) search- and planning-based inference (Tree of Thoughts, Graph of Thoughts, Buffer of Thoughts) — algorithms, costs, and follow-ups; (5) iterative refinement/self-correction (Reflexion, self-refine) and verification/ symbolic methods (theorem provers, symbolic solvers, retrieval+verify); (6) cross-cutting tradeoffs (model scale, compute/latency, interpretability, safety); and (7) practical recommendations and key papers/resources.

The idea of CoT is to prompt the model with exemplars that contain intermediate steps (rationales), which encourages the model to generate similar stepwise reasoning. CoT is thus a prompting (in‑context) method — no fine‑tuning required. ([ar5iv.org](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2201.11903v2))  \n",
            "- Scale and emergence: Wei et al. show CoT is an emergent ability of model scale — small models produce fluent but unreliable chains; the utility shows up for large models (roughly 100B+). Subsequent work showed that a simple zero‑shot \"Let's think step by step\" prompt can also elicit reasoning in many LMs (Zero‑Shot CoT, Kojima et al., 2022).

ToT produced large improvements on several tasks (e.g., Game of 24) but requires more inference queries and custom evaluation/generation prompts.

This interleaving enables \"reason to act\" (use reasoning to decide actions) and \"act to reason\" (use action results to inform subsequent reasoning). The authors implement this with few‑shot prompting of a frozen LLM (PaLM-540B and also GPT‑3 in appendices). ([ar5iv.org](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2210.03629))\n",

For knowledge tasks the paper used a small Wikipedia API with actions like search[entity], lookup[string], and finish[answer]; the model’s generated trajectory might look like: (paraphrase) Thought: “I need to search X and then read Y”; Action: search[X]; Observation: (returned snippet); Thought: “This says X happened in YEAR, so…”; Action: finish[answer].

This interleaving enables \"reason to act\" (use reasoning to decide actions) and \"act to reason\" (use action results to inform subsequent reasoning). The authors implement this with few‑shot prompting of a frozen LLM (PaLM-540B and also GPT‑3 in appendices). ([ar5iv.org](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2210.03629))\n",
