            "{'answer': 'Concise overview: Ownership vs Borrow Checker (with short examples and tips)\\n\\n1) Core idea (high level)\\n- Ownership: Every value in Rust has a single owner (a variable). When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped (automatic memory management without GC).\\n- Borrowing: You can lend access to a value via references (&T or &mut T) instead of transferring ownership.\\n- Borrow checker: A compiler phase that enforces rules about references to ensure memory safety (no use-after-free, no data races).\\n\\n2) Basic ownership rules\\n- Move semantics: Assigning or passing a non-Copy type (e.g., String, Vec<T>) moves ownership.\\n  Example:\\n  let s1 = String::from(\"hello\");\\n  let s2 = s1; // s1 moved, s2 now owns the String\\n  // using s1 here would be a compile error\\n\\n- Copy types (primitive integers, bool, char, types that implement Copy) are copied, not moved:\\n  let x = 5;\\n  let y = x; // both x and y usable\\n\\n- Clone to duplicate heap data explicitly:\\n  let s2 = s1.clone(); // deep copy; both usable\\n\\n3) Borrowing rules (enforced by the borrow checker)\\n- Immutable borrow: &T — many readers allowed.\\n- Mutable borrow: &mut T — only one mutable reference at a time, and it cannot coexist with immutable borrows.\\n- You cannot have both &T and &mut T overlapping in scope.\\n- References must not outlive the data they point to (lifetimes).\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\nMove example (error if used after move)\\nlet s1 = String::from(\"hi\");\\nlet s2 = s1;\\n// println!(\"{}\", s1); // error: value moved\\n\\nImmutable borrow (multiple readers)\\nlet s = String::from(\"hello\");\\nlet r1 = &s;\\nlet r2 = &s;\\nprintln!(\"{} {}\", r1, r2); // OK\\n\\nMutable borrow (single writer)\\nlet mut s = String::from(\"hello\");\\nlet r = &mut s;\\nr.push_str(\", world\");\\n// let r2 = &s; // error: cannot borrow as immutable while mutable borrow exists\\n\\nCommon error and fix (borrow lasts too long)\\nfn first_word(s: &String) -> &str { /* ... */ }\\nlet mut s = String::from(\"hello world\");\\nlet word = first_word(&s);\\ns.clear(); // error: cannot borrow `s` as mutable because `word` is an immutable borrow\\nFix: limit scope of borrow, or use owned data, or restructure:\\n{\\n    let word = first_word(&s);\\n    println!(\"{}\", word);\\n}\\ns.clear(); // OK\\n\\n4) Lifetimes (brief)\\n- Lifetimes are the compiler\\'s way of tracking how long references are valid.\\n- Often inferred; explicit lifetime annotations are needed when returning references that tie input lifetimes:\\nfn longest<\\'a>(x: &\\'a str, y: &\\'a str) -> &\\'a str {\\n    if x.len() > y.len() { x } else { y }\\n}\\n\\n5) Advanced/shared ownership / interior mutability (when borrowing rules are too strict)\\n- Rc<T> / Arc<T>: reference-counted shared ownership (Rc for single-threaded, Arc for multi-threaded). Rc gives shared ownership but only immutable access without interior mutability.\\n- RefCell<T>: single-threaded interior mutability — allows runtime-checked borrow rules (borrow_mut, borrow) and panics if rules violated.\\n- Mutex<T>/RwLock<T>: thread-safe interior mutability for multi-threading.\\n\\nExample: Rc + RefCell for multiple owners with mutation:\\nuse std::rc::Rc;\\nuse std::cell::RefCell;\\nlet data = Rc::new(RefCell::new(5));\\nlet a = Rc::clone(&data);\\n*data.borrow_mut() += 1;\\n\\n6) Practical tips & common fixes\\n- If you get \"value moved\" errors: either use the value before move, clone it, or borrow (&T).\\n- If you get \"cannot borrow as mutable because it\\'s also borrowed as immutable\": reduce borrow scope or avoid simultaneous borrows; clone or redesign to avoid long-lived borrows.\\n- If lifetimes are confusing: try to let the compiler infer them by rearranging code; add explicit lifetimes only when necessary.\\n- For shared mutation across owners, prefer Rc<RefCell<T>> (single-threaded) or Arc<Mutex<T>> (multi-threaded).\\n- Prefer references (& / &mut) for temporary access, and ownership transfers (moves) for clear long-term ownership.\\n- Keep borrow scopes minimal (limit lifetime of references by creating/using them in small blocks).\\n\\n7) Summary (one-liner)\\nOwnership gives deterministic cleanup and no runtime GC; the borrow checker enforces safe concurrent access rules at compile time (one mutable or many immutable references, no dangling references). Use moves, borrows, Rc/Arc, and interior mutability tools to express ownership and sharing patterns safely.', 'action': 'answer_direct', 'tool_result': ''}\n",

            "{'answer': 'Summary — Latest approaches to structured reasoning in LLMs (2022–2025)\\n\\n1) Two complementary families\\n- Internal structured inference (textual reasoning traces + search): make the model produce explicit intermediate steps and/or explore multiple possible intermediate states. Examples: Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Self-Consistency, Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT), Buffer-of-Thoughts (BoT), iterative self-refinement. These shape the model’s internal reasoning as explicit, explorable traces.\\n- Grounded/hybrid pipelines (externalization): have the LLM call tools, generate executable programs, or retrieve/verifiy evidence. Examples: PAL/PoT (program-as-reasoning), ReAct / Toolformer (tool-using agents), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and neuro-symbolic loops (formal provers, SMT, interpreters).\\n\\n2) Core methods — what they are and why they help\\n- Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting\\n  - Idea: prompt the model to output step-by-step intermediate text explanations before the answer.\\n  - Why: explicit decomposition improves multi-step problem solving (arithmetic, commonsense).\\n  - When to use: moderate-complexity reasoning where natural-language steps are helpful.\\n\\n- Self-Consistency (ensemble over CoT)\\n  - Idea: sample many CoT chains, extract answers, choose majority/consensus answer.\\n  - Why: reduces variance and single-path errors; simple and effective.\\n  - Trade-off: multiplies inference cost by #samples.\\n\\n- Tree/Graph/Buffer-of-Thoughts (ToT/GoT/BoT)\\n  - Idea: treat intermediate “thoughts” as nodes and perform search (expansion, scoring, backtracking, reuse).\\n  - Why: enables lookahead, backtracking, and reuse—crucial for planning, puzzles, and tasks with long-term dependencies.\\n  - Trade-off: high compute/latency; requires heuristics or learned evaluators for efficiency.\\n\\n- Program-Aided approaches (PAL / PoT / Chain-of-Code)\\n  - Idea: have the LLM emit code (Python, pseudocode) as the reasoning artifact and execute it in a sandbox/runtime.\\n  - Why: offloads exact computation, reduces arithmetic/logical mistakes, provides deterministic/verifiable output.\\n  - Risks: code safety, sandboxing, and semantic bugs in generated code.\\n\\n- Tool-augmented & Agentic methods (ReAct, Toolformer, Reflexion)\\n  - Idea: interleave thoughts, actions (API/tool calls), and observations; learn when to call tools.\\n  - Why: ground outputs in external knowledge/precise tools (search, calc, DBs); enables iterative improvement (Reflexion).\\n  - Engineering concerns: latency, security (prompt-injection, malicious tool outputs), orchestration complexity.\\n\\n- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\\n  - Idea: retrieve relevant documents and condition generation on them (open-book).\\n  - Why: improves factuality and verifiability for knowledge-intensive tasks.\\n\\n- Neuro-symbolic & formal-verifier loops\\n  - Idea: combine LLM high-level reasoning with symbolic engines (SMT, theorem provers, verifiers), autoformalization, and repair loops.\\n  - Why: essential for high-assurance domains (theorem proving, verified code). Challenges: symbol grounding and autoformalization errors.\\n\\n3) Benchmarks and empirical outcomes\\n- Common benchmarks: GSM8K, MATH, BigBench/BigBench-Hard, HotpotQA, HumanEval, Game-of-24, custom planning/puzzle suites.\\n- Representative results:\\n  - CoT + large models yielded big gains on GSM8K (2022).\\n  - PAL/PoT showed strong improvements by executing generated code for numeric tasks (2022–2023).\\n  - ToT/GoT show dramatic improvements on planning/search tasks (e.g., Game-of-24) where lookahead/backtracking matter.\\n  - Combining grounding (tools/programs/RAG) plus structured search typically gives best robustness.\\n\\n4) Main trade-offs and limitations\\n- Accuracy vs cost/latency: search/ensemble-based methods improve accuracy but increase inference cost; research works on adaptive/efficient search.\\n- Faithfulness vs plausible rationales: exposing intermediate steps helps interpretability but not all generated traces are faithful (possible post-hoc rationalization).\\n- New failure modes: self-refinement can cause “self-bias”; tool access increases attack surface (prompt-injection, poisoned retrieval), and generated code can be unsafe.\\n- Symbol grounding: mapping neural outputs to precise symbolic inputs remains brittle.\\n\\n5) Practical guidance — when to use which pattern\\n- Short numeric/symbolic problems requiring exact arithmetic: prefer program-aided (PAL/PoT) + execution + optional self-consistency.\\n- Planning/puzzles or tasks needing search/lookahead: use ToT/GoT/BoT with a scoring heuristic or learned evaluator; consider parallel/beam search to limit cost.\\n- Knowledge/factual QA: use RAG and tool-augmented ReAct/Toolformer-style pipelines with verification and citations.\\n- Iterative improvement / learning from trials: use Reflexion-like memory/reflection or self-refinement loops, but include external validators to avoid self-reinforcement of errors.\\n\\n6) Short list of must-read papers (start here)\\n- Wei et al., \"Chain-of-Thought Prompting...\" (2022)\\n- Wang et al., \"Self-Consistency Improves Chain-of-Thought...\" (2023)\\n- Yao et al., \"Tree of Thoughts\" (2023)\\n- Gao et al., \"PAL: Program-aided Language Models\" (ICML 2023)\\n- Schick et al., \"Toolformer\" (2023)\\n- Shinn et al., \"Reflexion\" (2023)\\n- Yang et al., \"Buffer of Thoughts\" (NeurIPS 2024)\\n- Recent surveys: 2024–2025 surveys on reasoning and neuro-symbolic pipelines\\n\\n7) Next steps I can do for you (pick one)\\n- Produce a 1–2 page annotated bibliography (TL;DR + links) of the ~12 key papers.\\n- Create a one-page “practical recipes” sheet with example prompts and a minimal PAL/ToT/ReAct code sketch (safe/sandboxed).\\n- Extract experimental numbers/tables from selected papers (GSM8K, Game-of-24, HumanEval) into a compact comparison table.\\n\\nWhich follow-up would you like?', 'action': 'answer_direct', 'tool_result': 'From the prior search: \"A major shift since 2022: prompting and structured inference schemes (Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, Tree/Graph/Buffer-of-Thoughts, program-aided and tool-augmented pipelines, retrieval-augmentation, and iterative self-refinement) have become the dominant ways to get LLMs to produce reliable multi-step (System-2 style) reasoning....
