      "- Use company content retrieved via vector search (certifications, data residency, integrations, support, Concierge Migration, Growth Summit SF, Acme Logistics case study, BUILD25 promo) as source material.\n",

      "- Keep language direct and useful for RevOps/Data/IT teams evaluating or onboarding Nimbus Scale in the EU.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justification:\n",
      "- The user asked for a launch blog targeted at EU customers with emphasis on compliance, residency, integrations, migration, support, event participation, a case study, and a promo code. The reasoning above ensures each requested item is covered with specifics from the retrieved content while maintaining a straightforward tone and practical next steps.\n",

      "Final Blog Draft:\n",
      "\n",
      "Introduction: Nimbus Scale for EU customers — what’s new and why it matters\n",
      "\n",
      "Nimbus is now available in a configuration built for EU customers. This launch bundles practical, operational changes you’ll notice right away: SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 certification, the ability to pin data to Frankfurt (eu-central-1), EU-focused operational support (private Slack windows and P1 on‑call coverage), and hands‑on Concierge Migration to remove rollout friction. We’ve also focused on lowering integration and implementation overhead with native connectors for systems you already run — notably Salesforce and Snowflake.\n",
      "\n",
      "This isn’t marketing fluff. These updates remove common blockers that slow down RevOps and Data teams: security and audit artifacts you can rely on, an option to keep primary data in the EU, predictable support patterns during rollout, and direct migration help so you don’t spend months moving logic and historical records by hand. Further below you’ll find practical details, limitations to watch for, and next steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Security & Compliance: SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001\n",
      "\n",
      "What we’ve done\n",
      "- Nimbus is certified to SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 and operates in alignment with GDPR requirements. These attestations mean independent auditors have reviewed our policies, controls, and how they operate over time.\n",
      "- Core controls covered include access management, encryption in transit and at rest, vulnerability management, change control, monitoring, and incident response. PII redaction is enabled by default and customer-managed keys are available on the Scale plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "What it means for procurement and audits\n",
      "- If you need evidence for vendor assessments or audits, we provide a compliance pack and audit artifacts under NDA. We also provide a standard Data Processing Agreement (DPA) for GDPR obligations.\n",
      "- Note: Nimbus is not configured for HIPAA workloads.\n",
      "\n",
      "Practical steps\n",
      "- Request the compliance pack from your account rep.\n",
      "- Sign the DPA if required.\n",
      "- If you need custom controls or evidence for a narrowly scoped audit, raise that with your Nimbus contact early in the procurement process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data residency in Frankfurt: how EU pinning works and GDPR alignment\n",
      "\n",
      "How pinning works\n",
      "- You can pin your Nimbus workspace to Frankfurt (eu-central-1). New accounts default to us-east-1, but you can select eu-central-1 at signup or request a migration of an existing workspace via Account settings or our Concierge Migration team.\n",
      "- Pinning ensures primary customer data (datasets and objects stored in Nimbus) is placed in infrastructure located in Frankfurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why this matters\n",
      "- Pinning reduces cross‑border storage by keeping data within the EU, simplifying certain GDPR and contractual requirements. Nimbus acts as a processor under the DPA and uses contractual safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) for transfers when needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Important operational notes\n",
      "- Region pinning covers Nimbus-hosted storage and backups but does not forcibly change how third‑party integrations behave. Connectors (Salesforce, Snowflake, analytics, webhooks) may route data through non‑EU endpoints depending on their configuration.\n",
      "- Before enabling a connector, verify its endpoint and configuration. Use field-level filtering, pseudonymization, or encryption for fields you don’t want transmitted outside the EU.\n",
      "\n",
      "Practical steps\n",
      "- Confirm your workspace region in Account settings.\n",
      "- Ask Concierge Migration for a migration plan to Frankfurt if necessary.\n",
      "- Request the subprocessors list and transfer mechanism documentation from support.\n",
      "- Review integration settings and document any external transfers for your data protection assessment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Integrations: Salesforce and Snowflake (what’s supported and why it helps)\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s supported\n",
      "- Salesforce: Native connector for standard CRM objects (Leads, Contacts, Accounts, Opportunities) plus support for common custom objects. Features include field mapping, transformations, bidirectional sync (write-back to Salesforce), and consuming Change Data Capture feeds for near-real-time updates.\n",
      "- Snowflake: Direct connector to read raw events, joins, and modeled tables and to write aggregated results or feature tables. Support for SQL-based transforms, scheduled syncs, and live queries so analysts can keep logic in the warehouse.\n",

      "Why this reduces friction\n",
      "- These integrations let you stop exporting CSVs and stitching spreadsheets. Nimbus orchestrates signals (from Snowflake), operational actions (back to Salesforce), and auditing so playbooks and scores are traceable and repeatable.\n",
      "- Pre-built mappings, templates, deduplication/conflict-resolution rules, and granular permissioning reduce manual cleanup and make implementation faster.\n",

      "EU-specific considerations\n",
      "- Connectors themselves may interact with infrastructure outside the EU. Verify connector endpoints and use available configuration options to prefer EU-hosted endpoints where possible.\n",
      "- Keep sensitive fields out of unnecessary flows and document lawful bases for any cross‑border transfers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Practical steps\n",
      "- Use the pre-built templates to accelerate setup.\n",

      "\n",
      "Program overview\n",
      "- Concierge Migration is a hands-on engagement to move schema, mappings, and historical data into Nimbus. The standard introductory offering is free for up to 20 hours and targets pilots, small-to-mid migrations, or time‑boxed migrations where the heavy lifting is the blocker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Typical process and timeline\n",
      "1. Kickoff: confirm scope, access, and acceptance criteria.\n",
      "2. Inventory & mapping: Nimbus engineers map source schema to Nimbus.\n",
      "3. Sandbox test migration: run tests and validations.\n",
      "4. QA & iterate: produce a QA report and iterate until acceptance.\n",
      "5. Production cutover: run the production migration, provide a runbook and rollback plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Most engagements that fit the 20-hour scope finish in 1–2 weeks, subject to access and stakeholder availability. If your migration needs more time, we’ll give a transparent quote for the remainder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deliverables & expectations\n",
      "- We deliver mapping artifacts, migration scripts or exports, a QA/validation summary, and a short runbook. You provide read access to sources, a point person for approvals, and a small set of acceptance tests (record counts, integrity checks, and a few business checks).\n",
      "\n",
      "Practical tips\n",
      "- Prioritize the tables/datasets powering your main workflows first.\n",
      "- Provide a sandbox where possible to speed testing.\n",
      "- Define small, clear acceptance criteria to avoid delays.\n",

      "Support: private Slack hours and P1 on-call coverage\n",
      "\n",
      "What support looks like\n",
      "- Private Slack hours: a dedicated channel between your team and Nimbus engineers for troubleshooting, configuration questions, and light operational guidance. These windows are scheduled during mutually agreed times so you know when an engineer will be available.\n",
      "- Typical scheduling: private Slack windows are arranged with your Customer Success lead. For EU customers, we schedule sessions to accommodate your local hours where practical.\n",
      "\n",
      "Escalations and SLAs\n",
      "- P1 on‑call: for production outages or severe degradation, declare a P1 via the private Slack channel (label the message clearly) and our PagerDuty-backed on‑call process will trigger. Scale customers can expect a critical response typically within 30 minutes.\n",
      "- Standard support: first response under 4 business hours for non‑critical issues.\n",
      "- Uptime: Nimbus maintains a 99.9% service uptime SLA.\n",
      "\n",
      "How to get the most from support\n",
      "- Agree upfront on private Slack hours with your Customer Success lead.\n",
      "- Document who on your team is authorized to declare a P1.\n",
      "- Supply runbooks or escalation contacts we should follow during incidents.\n",

This launch bundles three practical changes you’ll notice right away: enhanced security and compliance (SOC 2 and ISO 27001), Frankfurt data residency for customer data, and EU-focused operational support (private Slack support hours and a Concierge Migration service). We’re not selling fluff — we’re removing common blockers that slow down RevOps and Data teams so you can move from brittle spreadsheets to governed, AI-assisted workflows faster.\\n\\nWhat the compliance and residency updates mean in practice: SOC 2 and ISO 27001 give you an independently audited baseline for controls and risk management; Frankfurt data residency means records and analytics can remain within the EU to meet contractual or regulatory requirements. For teams evaluating vendors on security posture and data locality, those boxes are now checked without extra integration work on your side.\\n\\nWe also focused on reducing implementation friction. Native Salesforce and Snowflake integrations cut the time you spend stitching data and logic together, private Slack support hours give your team a direct, predictable line to Nimbus engineers during rollout, and our Concierge Migration service handles the heavy lift of moving rules, mappings, and historical data so your pipelines stay intact. In short: fewer manual processes, fewer one-off spreadsheets, and faster time to reliable revenue operations.\\n\\nThese platform and service updates are grounded in outcomes we’ve already seen. Customers like Acme Logistics improved lead-to-opportunity conversion by 23% and reduced churn by 12% after adopting Nimbus. If you’re evaluating a move or scaling an existing deployment, we’ve also got details on Growth Summit SF and a promo code (BUILD25) to help get you started.

By default new accounts use us-east-1, but you can choose eu-central-1 at signup or switch an existing workspace to Frankfurt through Account settings or by contacting our Concierge Migration team. Pinning ensures primary customer data — the datasets you upload and the objects you create in Nimbus — are stored in physical infrastructure located in the Frankfurt region.\\n\\nPinning to Frankfurt helps with GDPR compliance because it limits where your personal data is stored and reduces the need for cross‑border storage transfers. That said, region pinning is a technical control, not a legal guarantee. Nimbus acts as a processor under our Data Processing Agreement (DPA) and maintains independent certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001) to support secure processing. For transfer mechanisms, Nimbus relies on contractual safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) where necessary; please review the DPA and subprocessors list if you require specific contractual or regulatory assurances.\\n\\nImportant operational notes about scope and integrations: region pinning covers Nimbus-hosted storage and backups in eu-central-1 but does not automatically change how third‑party integrations behave. Connectors for Salesforce, Snowflake, analytics tools, or outbound webhooks may route data through external endpoints or non‑EU regions depending on their configuration. Before you enable a connector, check its settings and, when possible, choose European endpoints or keep data mappings minimal. If your integration requires routing outside the EU, document the lawful basis for the transfer and consider technical mitigations (field-level filtering, pseudonymization, encryption).\\n\\nHow to verify and next steps: confirm your workspace region in Account settings, ask Concierge Migration to perform a migration plan for existing accounts, and request the subprocessors and transfer mechanisms documentation from support. Enable recommended security controls — strong access policies, audit logging, and encryption — and keep a record of where sensitive fields are sent by integrations. If you need help assessing GDPR alignment for a specific use case (e.g., Salesforce sync or Snowflake warehousing), contact our EU support team during private Slack hours or open a support ticket and we’ll walk through the technical and contractual considerations.'},\n",

Our Salesforce connector covers standard CRM objects (Leads, Contacts, Accounts, Opportunities) and common custom objects, supports field mapping and transformation, and can push updates back to Salesforce or consume Change Data Capture feeds for near-real-time sync. That means updates made in Nimbus—segment changes, playbook triggers, or model outputs—can be written back to the exact fields and records your sales team uses.\\n\\nOn the Snowflake side, Nimbus connects directly to your warehouse to read raw events, joins, and modeled tables, and to write aggregated results or feature tables back when needed. You can run SQL-based transforms inside your Snowflake environment, schedule syncs, or use live queries for up-to-date signals. The Snowflake integration is designed to let you combine product telemetry, billing, and CRM data without exporting to ad-hoc files, so your scoring, attribution, and account-health calculations live where your analysts already work.\\n\\nBoth integrations are built for governance and low operational overhead: pre-built mappings and templates get you started, granular permissioning and audit logs keep changes traceable, and deduplication/conflict-resolution rules reduce the manual cleanup that breaks downstream reports. That practical approach is why customers see measurable improvements — for example, Acme Logistics increased lead-to-opportunity conversion by 23% and lowered churn by 12% after moving their processes into Nimbus and out of spreadsheets.\\n\\nIn short, Salesforce gives you a trusted operational record and Snowflake gives you the analytical ground truth; Nimbus orchestrates the two so RevOps can automate plays, Data can own the signals, and the rest of the GTM stack stays in sync.

Once you sign off, we run the production cutover and hand over a simple runbook and rollback plan. Most migrations that fit in the 20-hour program complete within one to two weeks, depending on access and how quickly stakeholders review results.\\n\\nWhat Nimbus delivers: a mapped schema, migration scripts or data exports as applicable, a QA/validation summary, and a short runbook for go‑live and rollback. What we expect from you: credentials and read access to the source system, a point person for approvals, and a small sample of acceptance tests (for example: record counts, key referential integrity checks, and a couple of end‑to‑end business checks). We design the work to minimize downtime and to leave you with repeatable artifacts should you want to repeat the migration or scale it later.\\n\\nPractical tips to make the engagement smooth: prioritize the tables or datasets that power your main workflows so those get done first; provide a sandbox if you can to speed up testing; and set clear, small acceptance criteria (record counts and a handful of business checks are usually enough). If your migration looks like it will exceed the free 20 hours, we’ll give a transparent quote for the remainder. Customers who take the time to get the migration and validation right tend to see faster downstream results with Nimbus — which is why we focus the Concierge Migration on the technical details you don’t want to manage in-house.'},\n",

We offer private Slack hours — a dedicated channel between your team and our engineers — for troubleshooting, configuration questions, and light operational guidance. These sessions are scheduled during mutually agreed windows so you always know when a Nimbus engineer is available to respond in real time.\\n\\nPrivate Slack hours are intended for operational help and rapid triage. Use the channel to share logs, screenshots, and steps to reproduce; our engineers will work with your team to diagnose issues and create a follow-up ticket when deeper investigation is needed. This channel is not a substitute for long-term project work, but it accelerates day-to-day problem solving and short turnaround requests.\\n\\nFor critical incidents, Nimbus Scale includes P1 on-call coverage. A P1 is a production outage or severe degradation that prevents core business functions. When you declare a P1 through the private Slack channel (clearly labeled as P1), our on-call process is triggered and a response will be provided under the Scale critical SLA — typically within 30 minutes. For non-critical requests, our standard support SLA remains in effect (first response under 4 business hours); Nimbus also maintains a 99.9% uptime SLA for the service itself.\\n\\nTo get the most from support, agree upfront on private Slack hours with your Customer Success lead, document who is authorized to declare P1s, and include runbooks or escalation contacts we should follow. If you need to set up private Slack hours or confirm your P1 contacts, reach out to your Nimbus account manager and we’ll get it scheduled.'},\n",
